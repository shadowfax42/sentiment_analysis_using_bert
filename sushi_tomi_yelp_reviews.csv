0,"Great Japanese restaurant in the area, with well executed classics for an affordable price. But be prepared for a wait. Visited on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was packed. All tables full and maybe a 15 minute wait? Service was attentive but not doting, which is fine. A few highlights of the food: Sashimi is very good - huge portions and high quality. We got a few bento combos that had sashimi, and where most places would give you 4-5 2""x1""x0.5"" pieces, here you get absolutely gigantic pieces, maybe 50% more fish per slice. Quality is super good, very fresh and well selected cuts. No stringiness! Major highlight was the tuna kama (pictured) which was a special. Huge, roasty, and rich fish flavor. Bring a few friends, because this is definitely meant to be shared. Would definitely come again, although maybe on a quieter night. (Sushi, sashimi, grill items, tuna kama)"
1,"Service was incredibly slow and felt incredibly chaotic inside. Servers were running and rushing around, felt low on staff. We had high expectations because of all the high ratings however, food did not deliver.The quality of the toro in the negitoro was below expectations. You cannot taste much of the fish and the texture felt mushy. The deluxe chirashi special was alright. There was a good variety of fish.The tomi special was probably our favourite, more complex flavours and fattier fish."
2,"Came with a friend on a weekday for lunch. It was pretty crowded even though we went around 1 pm, but we were able to find a seat immediately.I got the lunch combo with tonkatsu and beef teriyaki, and it comes with miso soup, salad, and rice. We also got an order of the hamachi nigiri and a rainbow roll. The lunch combo was decent. The tonkatsu was pretty good and the batter wasn't too heavy. The pork itself was tender and juicy, even though the cutlets were pretty thin. The beef, on the other hand, was tough and lacked flavor apart from the teriyaki sauce. The hamachi was fresh and not too fishy; very solid, but also nothing special. The rainbow roll had too much mayo in it, which overpowered the other flavors in the roll. The fish on top was fresh and if eaten apart from the roll, would've been good. So unless you like mayo, maybe don't order the rainbow roll.The service was straightforward and quick. There was street parking in the area as well as a parking lot nearby, a couple blocks down."
3,"We came around Wednesday dinner time, and there was quite a few people on the waitlist. It took around 20 minutes to get seated at the bar.The employees are very friendly and make sure that you are ok throughout your meal. We got tempura, yaki onigiri, tuna, and the chiraishi. Price wise, not too bad. Food wise, it was also not too bad, but also did not wow me. I was expecting the yaki onigiri to behave crispy rice on the outside, but it wasn't crispy. The fish tasted fresh, and was pretty decent. The tempura was also pretty good.Overall, nothing to complain about, but also nothing that impressed. A solid place to go when you are craving some fish!"
4,"Looking for fresh sushi in downtown MV? This is your place! Solid cuts of sashimi (definitely try their fatty tuna) and decently priced, although still quite expensive. The price does limit you from trying too much but overall great service, location is small but quaint, and great quality of food. will definitely come back."
5,Been coming here for the past few months and their quality and price can't be beat! Very easy to call in for pickup and food is usually ready in 20-25 min. For in restaurant dining I recommend going at off peak times to avoid the wait.
6,"I quite like this place!I guess I have been here two times now.  Once many many eons ago, when I came here with a girlfriend and her mother.  It was probably the first time that we all went out together, so I had to be a good little boi and on my best behaviour.  It went as well as it could, but I wasn't really looking for anything that serious in my life and that point.  Sometimes you just date people for a time, even though you know it probably won't end in marriage. And let's be honest - I'm thinking that marriage itself is an antiquated construct that we have forced ourselves to believe in.  Hell, even my own mother said, ""Kids just add so much stress to a relationship, especially the third one.  God I wish we had stopped at two.""Thanks, mom.Will I ever get married?  Who knows.  Probably not.  We can just all live our lives and do whatever feels right, ya know?  So let's cheers to that, my brothers and sisters!  Let us all live our best lives :DOh yeah!  The food is good and the ambiance is quiet.  There, Yelp, I fulfilled your demands."
7,"One of a few Japanese restaurant that is owned by Japanese person. They do not take reservations and you will have to wait a long line if you don't show up 30 minutes before they open. They have two locations in Mountain View and San Jose. They are both good compared to the quality of fish, the price is very reasonable. Omakase is my recommendation. Family friendly environment."
8,My family and I came by for dinner and were very happy with our meal. The fish quality was good and fresh for all dishes! Service was quick and friendly. I would recommend this spot :)
9,"Good quality fish at Mountain View prices. Perhaps a bit understaffed, and that sometimes comes through in the dining experience, but the food outshines the service here.This place is a popular spot, and you'll always see people lining up before it opens. They have a lot of different traditional options, but my personal favorite is the sake don. It's just salmon, but the richness of the salmon is perfect with a bit of soy sauce over rice. The tekka don is just as good for the tuna lover - great quality tuna. While the karaage wasn't much of a standout (it was fine), the rolls and nigiri were all quite good. I personally loved the toro and will always try to order a piece when offered at restaurants. My service experience that day was satisfactory, as I went in right at the opening time and got in an order before the lunch rush happened."
10,"Sushi Tomi is located off of Castro and is a hidden gem. There was a wait to be seated on a Saturday evening. We waited about 30-45 minutes. Worth it though. The sashimi is amazing! Great quality! I found myself eating the pieces slowly to savor the fish. Nigiri roll was also tasty. I believe the other roll we received was a super bomb roll, which is a must get. I wish we were able to add cream cheese. It would've been next level. The grilled pork was very chewy; would not get again. Miso soup is as expected. The price is a little higher compared to other sushi spots, but worth the extra! Highly recommend! The restaurant is small so it's probably best to come when they open to decrease likelihood of a longer wait. There's a parking lot across the restaurant and street parking is available."
11,"First time here today and it was a good one. The Tomi Special Roll did not disappoint, fresh fish, and delicious sauce. It was the highlight of this lunch meal. The regular salmon and unagi rolls are decent. The fish are soft fresh. But would recommend the special rolls for better taste. Tried the skewers and they were okay, but for the price would rather have ordered another roll instead or another dish. But still good to try. It was a busy lunch hour, long line, had to wait for 15+ mins to get seated. All parties must be present. The waiter was attentive and friendly. The food was delivered at an acceptable pace, the skewers take longer though. Next time, will just stick to sushi and rolls. The place is small and crowded, but good to try if you like sushi rolls. Best time would be to beat the lunch crowd and to check their hours of operation."
12,"I haven't been here in years. There is a wait but only because they don't have enough staff. The 3 wait staff have to do it all for their tables - clear tables. seat people, take orders, and bring food. There is no separate host / greeter or someone clearing tables. The sushi menu has no descriptions of the sushi and the sushi roll list is very small. Everyone around us had the lunch bento. The portion is great but they forgot the ginger and the also the salad dressing. It's quite loud and hard to have a decent conversation. The ahi sashimi was fresh. The salmon teriyaki was over cooked for my taste. The salad dressing was ranch (?). I feel like this used to be the go to place but now outdated. They need a structure. And new descriptive menus with pictures."
13,"I haven't had sushi for a while so this was really nice. There are quite a few places to eat sushi in the Bay Area, however some of the places I prefer to go are closed on Sunday and Mondays (and that's when I'll be in town) so we decided to try something new to us. We were meeting a friend in Mountain View and I looked up some spots, Sushi Tomi has solid reviews and I agree with that. It was relatively busy even though we arrived shortly after it opened for dinner, but we were able to get a table right away. We chose some different rolls to share and I had one of my favorite things- unagi. I don't share that typically haha. I also tried the katsu don dinner and it was pretty tasty as well. It was a lot of food in the bowl so I took most of it with me. Overall, Sushi Tomi is yummy and I had some great company to enjoy it with :)"
14,"This is a nice, authentic sushi joint just off of Castro street. We really enjoyed it. I would say it is a great place if you are coming for fresh delicious sushi but if you're getting an entree you can probably find better. My husband got the sushi sampler and that is the way to go - for $22ish they give you a large plate of pieces from multiple rolls. I tried the combo meal with teriyaki chicken and gyoza and the chicken was pretty good but I wouldn't rave about the gyoza. Very quick service. They seemed to want to flip the tables quick so not the best place if you're wanting to hang and socialize. Overall happy with this find."
15,"So I really want to love this place since it has so much hype and I was so excited to try it out. The quality of fish is great and the price is reasonable, but the major issue to this supposedly perfect meal was -- the rice just didn't taste right. Everyone in our table agreed that it lacks that familiar hint of sweetness which vinegar sushi rice is supposed to taste like. If you have sushi a lot you'll know the exact flavor I'm referring to. The rice here just tastes bland and salted with the vinegar flavor, and unfortunately that throws the whole flavor off. I hope it's just a miss and not the norm that their sushi rice tastes like this, since it's only my first time here so idk if the quality is consistent. If this is how their sushi rice always tastes like I really hope they can improve their rice recipe, so the fresh quality of fish is not compromised."
16,"I got seated pretty quickly I went after work so I didn't have to wait. The sashimi dinner came with rice, miso soup, and a salad. It was delicious. The tomi roll was scrumptious too -- I got hamachi. I would recommend this place. The roll was killer!"
17,"Our favorite sushi place since we've moved to the Bay Area 4 years ago. This was a go-to when we lived in Mountain View, and now that we live in south San Jose we still make our way out here to get the best sushi! Pro tip: come early close to their opening (5pm) to avoid a long wait. We always start off with miso soups and side salad. Their dressing is light and fresh, and goes well with the veggies.We always order the Tomi Special, BBQ eel roll, and the Dragon roll. Tomi special (5/5) - My husbands favorite thing here. It's a spicy tuna roll with avocado, with hamachi and salmon. You get a choice of the seared fish on top and we always choose sake. They torch the top so there is a nice sear, and they add a touch of micro greens and onions along with a creamy spicy mayo sauce. BBQ eel and dragon roll (5/5) - both are solid choices if you enjoy eel. The Dragon roll only has 4 pieces but they're decent sized pieces with plenty of eel and avocado, and it's pretty filling. Honestly, all of their rolls are good and you won't go wrong because of the quality and freshness of their fish. The most reliable and delicious sushi place we've been to!"
18,"Went to this place on accident while trying to route to Tomi Sushi in Santa Clara, but it turned out to be a pleasant surprise! My friend and I both ordered the sashimi lunch, and it was so fresh and tasty. There were about 9 pieces I believe, and each piece was a very decent size and the entire meal was very filling! The lunch came with a side of soup and a small salad, with some sort of mayo-based sauce. We also ordered a couple of small rolls which were delicious as well. Looks like I finally found a good sushi place in the Bay Area. I definitely would come again!"
19,"We used to come here before they remodeled but haven't had a chance to come by since they reopened but we stopped by today and was really disappointed. The fish quality has gone down a lot and the service left something to be desired. We ordered a number of rolls, some tempura, nigiri, and yakitori. The rolls and nigiri came out decently quick and as we started eating, noticed a small hair on one of the rolls. We informed our waiter and pointed to where it was and at first couldn't spot it but then started giving us a side glance as if it was ours. There was no apology and he instead said he would take it to the chef to look at. He came back and said that he would give us a new roll and gave a really half assed apology. The tempura came out about 10 mins after the sushi but there was no sign of the yakitori. The replacement roll came out and still no yakitori. Then as we were almost done, one of the nearby tables that sat down halfway through our service was given their yakitori and the waiter came by a few minutes later and asked if we received our yet. I replied that we didn't need it anymore since we were almost done eating and he says that it's done and he will bring it out. The waiter had asked when I placed the order if we wanted it with salt or teriyaki and I said teriyaki since our kids are with us and they would like it better. We got the salt one instead. All in all, it's left us with a pretty bad impression. I don't know if they lost their chef or changed owners, but this isn't the Sushi Tomi that I remember and I don't think we'll be back."
20,"We love this place and come here every week or so. Out of all of the sushi in Mountain View, this is the highest quality one and they have a great selection of other non-sushi items as well. It does get busy so be sure to come early or as we have been doing, ordering ahead early. Their phone lines stay busy so be a little patient when calling!"
21,"I got the Extra Special Sushi, which came with a miso soup. It was $33 and came with 8 pieces of premium sushi and a negi toro roll, which I felt like was good value. I especially liked the toro, salmon, and sweet shrimp. The fish was thick and tasted fresh. The other pieces were pretty standard. However, they ran out of uni the day I went, and I asked if I could get double of something else in the original set, but was told no and that they can only give me a crab nigiri. There was very little crab, and it was definitely not worth the price of a piece of uni."
22,Had dinner with a friend here at the bar area. i had the nigiri special and i loved it! The fish are thick cuts and cured perfectly and the rice perfectly balanced. The atmosphere near the sushi making section feels much like a sushi house in Japan. The service is also on point - but do note this probably isn't a place you can hang for a long time slowly over drinks. They get pretty busy
23,"Sadly, we will no longer be ordering food from Tomi sushi despite having been coming here as customers for years. I am not sure if they sold the business to a new owner, but this last visit was so disappointing that we have decided not to return. To start, my 10 year old's favorite dish is the Nabeyaki udon. The restaurant told us they no longer will serve udons for take out due to a new law in Mountain View prohibiting single use containers for take out. Despite this claim they put the rest of our food in the same single use container the udon was served in. Huh?! Not only was this a ridiculous claim given they put all the other food in the same container, but all the other surrounding restaurants will serve soup for take out without any mention of this ""so-called"" law. So what gives? We decided to order anyway and give them the benefit of the doubt. Once we arrived we noticed that they didn't include the miso soups that usually come with the dinners. When we went to tell them they forgot the soups they told us they put miso paste in the bag and we would have to make it ourselves by adding hot water at home. Come again?! So basically we are paying for a dinner we have to make ourselves at home? Fast forward to when we got home. They basically put two packets of paste and seaweed with no instructions in English into the bag (see photos attached). The packages were in Japanese and no one informed us how much water to use so we just eyeballed it. Needless to say it wasn't great. Lastly, and this is the most important issue. The food quality has definitely dropped significantly. I was going to give the restaurant two stars until we tasted the food. With the exception of the shrimp in the super chirachl bowl, the rest of the fish was smaller in portion and tasted bland compared to before. Our 10 year old ended up getting the beef teriyaki which was chewy and gross. For the amount of money we dropped on this place for take out, the service and food should have been way better. Be forewarned before you decide to go. This place has really gone downhill."
24,Always loved Sushi Tomi! food is delicious every single time I go anddd the wait time isn't as bad bc it goes by pretty fast.
25,"My go to sushi spot in the bay. Great value for the quality of fish. My favourite thing is the extra special chirashi, never disappoints.The appetizers here are also top notch, i always get the shishamo tempura."
26,"I have been her for a business dinner. Will say the food was for free and this review is not emotional biased.The sushi is very fresh, and the service was quick.The busy hours are really busy and you will wait, which is probably standard these days for better places.The only downside but still not so bad to lower to 4 stars is that the fresh wasabi didn't hit the sweet spot. It felt like that it was not worth the money compared to the standard wasabi which comes with the regular dishes... but that was our impression, maybe we do not know what we are talking about anyway!Ambiance was ok but somewhat crunched. Still not a deal breaker (maybe if you are a heavier person!?)."
27,"Went here with some friends, and as you know usually not everyone can arrive at the same time. I arrived first, and the waitstaff made me wait outside for my friends. I understand why they don't seat people right away, but I wish I was invited inside because it is getting colder in the evenings. Food was great, got the special chirashi dinner and the customizable assorted sashimi dinner to share. Only tuna option was maguro, no albacore or hamachi the day we went. Wonderful food, average service, price average. If you just want good food, casual dining and don't have a huge party, this is a great place."
28,"Food was good, as usual.  Finally had a chance to eat in the restaurant for dinner.  Service was very attentive.  The rolls were good as well as the chicken teriyaki and mixed tempura.  The combination comes with salad, soup and rice.  So come with a decent appetite."
29,"Have been here several times and has been consistent.  Now that our old standby Japanese restaurant is closed, Sushi Tomi has taken over that honor.  It's a super busy place and plan for parking around busy downtown Mountain View.  Portions are generous and food is very good at this local favorite."
30,"Ridiculous wait time followed by slow, awful service. Blah food at premium prices. So disappointing"
31,"amazing sushi, great service. crowded, always so plan ahead! Highly recommend all of their rolls, ordering takeout is also good option."
32,"Love the extra special chirachi bowl - great value considering you get tons of fish, ebi, uni and other chefs special. Agedashi tofu and tempura were ok. The nigiris, especially salmon and otoro, are excellent too! My girlfriend loves the mix don which comes with salmon, tuna and yellowfish- excellent choice if you like these the most!We come here often so it's great that the fishes vary in the chirashi bowl. One con is that there is usually a 45 min wait on saturday and sunday"
33,"Love the extra special chirachi bowl - great value considering you get tons of fish, ebi, uni and other chefs special. Agedashi tofu and tempura were okay"
34,Chirashi bowl was excellent!!! Very nice quality with a range of fish and other raw seafood.
35,"Extra special chirashi bowl was one of the best chirashi bowl's I've ever had! I normally don't care too much for sweet shrimp, and will eat it if it comes with my food but theirs was so good I am now a fan and would definitely order it again there! Everything on the chirashi bowl tasted so fresh and amazing. Definitely easier to get a table when it's just a couple people eating. I imagine large groups would have to wait a long time. Service was pleasant and they seem to genuinely care."

37,"""This is the best fresh fish tuna,"" says my hungry, sushi-lovin' companion. It apparently passed his HAPA test (half Japanese). He keeps talking about coming back here. Like I live right around the corner so I don't know why he keeps telling me.I ordered the Bento box with tempura (shrimp and veggies) along with the salmon teriyaki. I could see that the other table was ""eyeing"" our food and had ordered the tempura after they saw what we got. Some tips:- Wait is a LONG time like at least 1-2 hours during meal times. Put your name down and walk around downtown. - Might want to consider take out. The place is small. - Parking on the street or in the surrounding neighborhood.- Always choose either bar or table to shorten your wait time.If my companion has anything to do with it, we'll be back."
38,"Busy, its food is ok. It used to lot better. Long wait and service is all by non Japanese :)"
39,"** Great South Bay sushi option with a homey feel. Extensive menu at a relatively fair price point.Sushi Tomi is definitely my current go-to in the Bay Area for Japanese food. My favorite item is their Tomi roll with Hamachi, and they have all the classic rolls and nigiri as well. They have quite a long sushi menu with pretty much whatever you could want and think of. Fish is overall fresh tasting and gets the job done. Of the items I've tried the Tomi roll is the more unique item, and everything else tastes as expected in a good way. Outside of sushi, their chicken katsu is also something I've ordered multiple times. I'd say the price point is overall solid - if you get several items of sushi it'll add up but especially compared to other Bay Area spots its definitely not the worst.I'm a huge matcha lover and their green tea is really solid considering that its complimentary. Definitely on the higher end of teas that I've had come included in a Japanese restaurant; I always end up getting multiple refills before the end of the meal.The interior is a bit smaller and there is a waitlist sheet to put your name down on. Typically this place can get busy, so expect to have a wait especially for dinner even on weekday nights. Don't forget to grab a lollipop on way out!"
40,"I would like to give this place a 4.5 stars, the tuna was okay. I did round up. I came here for a Valentine's dinner. We got here a little after 5pm. We got lucky with parking because the parking lot across the street wasn't packed like it usually is. We walked to the the restaurant and signed in. The wait was less than 5 minutes, I would say. We got a regular sashimi and special sashimi platter. Also, a few nagiris. For the menu, we scanned the QR code. It was separated by  appetizer, lunch, dinner, and drinks. Overall, service was decent and fish was somewhat fresh."
41,"Came by for lunch the other day and it was a mediocre experience. Street parking was plentiful 15 minutes prior to opening on a Friday morning. There was already a line forming and the staff allowed parties where everyone arrived to be seated a few minutes prior to opening.Staff wore a uniform t-shirt and a mask. Menus were available via QR code next to the table along with a paper menu for sushi.Started off with the soup and salad. The salad felt like time travel with simple lettuce and a ton of mayo on the dressing...The soft shell crab had a very thick batter...yikes...The unagi don was also different. Unlike previous visits with fluffy rice, very thick and shiny unagi with a side of egg omelet, the rice was low on sauce and the unagi was no longer super thick as before. Instead of a ton of unagi, there were merely a few slices and tempura vegetables on top?!? The tomi roll with spicy tuna was decent. Minimal rice, spicy tuna on the inside, seared fish on the outside with some thinly sliced purple onions on top.The roll took a while so had to check up with the staff on it. In return, the staff asked if everything was okay and presented us a check at the same time, due to a line out the door?!?~$30/head after tax and gratuity for lunch."
42,"Came by for lunch the other day and it was a tasty meal. Parking is available in the city-owned lot across the street. Street parking is plentiful.Managed to be seated at the bar upon arrival and started off with the miso soup and side salad. Both were okay. The side salad was premade and the dressing was mediocre at best.Both the Tomi roll with spicy tuna and salmon toro nigiri were tasty. Rolls were freshly made with fresh fish. The sauces on the Tomi roll provided a nice contrast to the roll. The toro was quite fatty too!The unagi don was decent. There were 4 huge pieces of fish along with a huge piece of egg omelet. The unagi was decent, although there wasn't enough sauce for the entire bowl of rice. Service was efficient!~$27/head after tax and gratuity for lunch."
43,Came by for dinner the other night and it was decent experience. The line was out the door upon arrival and was rather quick as we opted to sit at the bar.The dining room was a tad warm and our waitress was rather robotic..Started off with the miso soup which was a tad salty. Their side salad was 95% lettuce... The Tomi Sushi roll with spicy tuna was delicious. A tad spicy on the inside with some fresh fish topped off the roll that was slightly charred. Definitely a unique experience!The unagi Don was huge with thick cuts of unagi along with a huge bowl of rice. The sauce was a tad salty on this visit.Their salmon belly nigiri was quite tasty too... Nice and fatty!The tempura shrimps were freshly made and quite tasty. Restaurant seems to cater to the more pedestrian clientele.$35/head after tax and gratuity for dinner.
44,"Came by for lunch the other day and managed to squeeze in at the sushi bar as all the tables were already full! There was this mainland China lady that was rather curt requesting to fill out the sign in sheet, stopping by every 2 minutes attempting to take my order... :(The Tomi Special Roll was tasty as before. Spicy tuna in the middle with a thin layer of sushi rice and a piece of fried seaweed. The roll was topped with some salmon and scallops, lightly seared with a torch, and then finally topped with some purple onions and some sauce. The Spicy Tuna Hand Roll was also tasty and a decent portion. Tuna was nice and spicy too!My rolls were made by a Caucasian sushi kid behind the counter. $25/head after tax and gratuity for a light lunch!Their Bento boxes seem best value but didn't seem too appealing as I saw most items being prepared prior to be being ordered..."
45,"Came by for dinner the other night and it was impressive. Started off with the miso soup and it was slightly better than the one on Moorpark, although a tad salty.Moved on to the Unagi Don which had 4 huge pieces of thick cuts of Unagi. The rice was fluffy and flavorful while the Unagi was excellent. There was also a small piece of the egg too! :)Service was friendly by the staff.~$24 after tax and tip for dinner."
46,"Definitely one of the better, authentic Japanese-owned Japanese restaurants in Mountain View. The restaurant has stayed roughly the same throughout the years with a slight remodel on the inside.The was a slight wait for a seat at the bar.The miso soup and house salad were both okay, nothing too special.The Sushi Tomi roll was okay at $12.90. In hindsight, I would have preferred a non-seared salmon on my roll...but it was still tasty.Also ordered the Salmon Belly Nigiri which was indeed very fatty and tasty. At $6.40 for a couple pieces, it was definitely on the pricier side.At ~$27 a person, definitely on the higher end of prices for a casual Japanese restaurant."
47,"We made a reservation for a party of 3 for 6:45 pm on a Saturday night a couple hours ahead of time. We arrived on time and were seated quickly. Some of us ordered the Sushi Tomi Special which consisted of a lobster salad on the inside with scallops on the outside, quite delicious. I topped off my meal with a spicy tuna hand roll and a soup and salad. The waitress gave us some grilled salmon which was ""on the house"", apparently to every table seated that evening...nice touch.Our tab came out to be ~$27/person. The sushi, salad, and soup were all very fresh, definitely will return again soon! :D"
48,"Authentic place for sushi (their sushi chefs are always real Japanese sushi chef, at least whenever I went). Their rolls were honestly okay, but their always my trusted place to get sashimi and freshly cut fish.This was the first place I tried Hamachi kama and it was delicious! I've always ordered it ever since.Make sure to try their agedashi tofu too!"
49,"a neighbor favorite of mountain view, rarely seen without a line out the door. sushi tomi offers a staple selection or nigiri and sashimi, with a couple or simple rolls as well. they also have a wide sampling of fried and broiled appetizers, as well as bento dinners. but this is best a place for sushi lovers. the service can be a little slow since they are often packed but the quality is never lacking"
50,I moved to MV from SF and I'm a really big foodie person. I'm always looking for new sushi spots to try since I'm a bit far from my go to spot in the city. Found this sushi spot in downtown MV and I would recommend this place! It's not too pricey and the food is good. I recommend trying the Tomi Special if you like a lil kick to your rolls. The Extra Special Nirigi comes with 8pcs. There was supposed to be Uni but it's not in season so it wasn't available. I was a bit bummed by that but the food is great! Tip: come here close to opening time at 5pm because it does get pretty busy later on. Glad we came right when they opened.
51,"The freshest sushi you can get in the bay area. I usually get take out and the sushi taste amazingly freshly prepared.  I hate that sushi is so expensive, but if you want to splurge, this is the place to get the best tasting and freshest sushi consistently in the bay area. I'm sure service isn't top notch, but nothing beats the food quality. Go and try, your pocket book will not be happy, but your stomach will be."
52,"The very best sushi in Silicon Valley. Everything is fresh. Even though it's busy, the service is fantastic. It's one of the greatest places to have Japanese food."
53,"I swear to God you will never eat a California Roll more delicious than this - anywhere on this planet (I qualified this, because there may other sushi places in the universe, of which I have yet to try).  Tuna was fantastic, too  Wait service - unbelievably attentive, even as busy as it always is.  You will have to wait for all the Google people and Facebook people (probably Apple, too) to finish - they cause huge wait times because this place is extremely popular in Silicon Valley.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  But please try their California Rolls.  PS - when you eat there, you will understand the long wait times."
54,Favorite casual sushi in the Bay. I didn't love the bento special of the day (I think lots of people would like it but a lot of the protein was either bony or fatty) so am going to stick with the sushi from here on out.
55,"A great place for dinner and always packed, but the service is fast and the line moves very quickly. We enjoy dining here when we want a combination of sushi as well as other Japanese entrees. If you only want sushi, they do not have many of the fancy rolls you find at other sushi restaurants. But the quality of the fish is good and the sushi chefs fulfill the orders at a very fast rate. Always reliable, reasonable wait time and great service."
56,"My bf and I stopped by for dinner on a Friday night around 7:30 and waited about 30 minutes for a table. Service was wonderful, they had an omakase dinner for $90 that came with three appetizers, one chef's choice and the other two you can pick from a small list. We originally wanted to order agadeshi tofu and takoyaki as our appetizers but the waitress said that those items were inexpensive and that it would be cheaper to order those a La carte. We sat there struggling to pick so she recommended the grilled squid and offered to do a kanpachi kama which was not on the list of choices. We also got a few nigiris on top of the omakase since we were sharing. We were so surprised when our appetizers came, they were GIGANTIC. The grilled squid could have easily fed 4 or more and they have us the ENTIRE fish head and collar. Both were excellent and I would definitely order them again. They also gave us and the table next to us a fried shrimp head. Overall we had a wonderful experience as first time diners, the fish was fresh, service was great, and we left with full bellies."
57,"The beef tongue is quite tough and have a weird small. It does not seems to be fresh.All the nigiri are greats. Uni is fresh and sweet. We also ordered Toro , white tuna, fatty tuna. All good.I always love the futomaki roll, but I found this little secrect in their roll. There are characters with good meaning on top of the sweet egg piece. Just so cute and love it!The service is good, but the wait could be long since it is a small and popular place."
58,"Sushi tomi continues to be my favorite South Bay sushi restaurant. I've been here multiple times and love the homey feel. Since there are no reservations- get there early, put your name down on their waitlist, and wait outside until your table is ready. My absolute favorite item is their special roll with hamachi (salmon is good too). Their nigiri is always consistent, but they can be heavy handed with the wasabi so request light/no wasabi if that's your preference. For entrees, I've tried a bunch- tonkatsu, tempura, donburis- you really can't go wrong!"
59,Best Sunday bento! Wonderful service. Fresh and consistently high-quality seafood. Arigatou gozaimasu!
60,"The sushi and sashimi dishes at this restaurant are consistently good every time we went there, probably one of the best in the area. There can be wait if you don't show up early enough."
61,I come to Sushi Tomi often. Sushi is very fresh here and the service is also good. I normally avoid coming here around noon time because it is very busy. You have to wait for a long time. Either 11:30 am or 1:00 pm is good time time to come.
62,"Sunday lunch is crowded, every table was full. The menu is long and they provided different lunch combos. We ordered the white tuna don, the special sushi, salmon hand roll and amaebi nigiri. The sashimi is very fresh, just a bit disappointed by the special sushi nigiri combo, I was expecting better choice of fish and tops. Staff were really busy and running around but did get everything correct for the order. The people sitting next to us were a bit noisy that day."
63,"My husband and I had a nice evening out (kid free) and we came across this place. Definitely on my list to visit again if I'm in the area. We ordered tempura shrimp and veggies, tomi special roll with hamachi to share. The tempura was nice and crispy. But the Tomi sushi roll was what really stood out for us. It was stuffed with hamachi and topped with more hamachi and scallops. Garnished with microgreens and red onions.  Omg, drool! It was soooo good!!  My husband got the bento box with tonkatsu and beef sukiyaki (+$3). OMG we have never tried beef sukiyaki and the broth was heavenly and so heart-warming! Well worth the extra $3 because that in itself was a full entree. I got the extra special chirashi bowl. Amazing!! And it came with a fried shrimp head which I wasn't expecting when it came out shortly after.  I gave my husband tuna sashimi to try but honestly didn't want to share. I only did because it was so fresh and delicious. I had to share the experience with him! Ahaha Of course we enjoyed all this food with some hot sake.Always a plus-- waitress was friendly and attentive. Checking in on us and filling water glasses without us asking. Love that!  She also gave us an extra bowl of miso soup!  Many reasons to come back!!!"
64,"The sushi chef and waitress helped me save money. I ordered 8 pieces of salmon nigiri, and they come out and tell me if I order salmon Don, it will also have 8 pieces of salmon and come with even more rice. And a bowl of miso soup is also included in the Don. And it's less expensive lol.Nice place. They're really busy but they still spend the time explaining things like this to me and help me save money. Unbelievable.Oysters are really good too. Definitely will bring all my friends here.Ambiance makes me feel like I'm in Japan. A lot of people speaking Japanese in the restaurant. That's how you know it's authentic Japanese food."
65,"Popped in to place a to go order. After paying $80 plus tip I was hoping to sit down 10 min & have a tea since plenty of seating was available at the sushi bar area & other tables. The hostess snapped wait outside & come back in 15 min. I woulda loved a green tea @ the bar after a rough morning. But was kicked out rudely. Plus, my son got sick after eating it. Was warm sushi."
66,"One of my favorite sushi places. This is not your pedestrian sushi... it's artisan sushi with specialty fish. You can never go wrong with omakase. Today we opted for the sushi but you can also get omakase sashimi. I love the variety and presentation. We also ordered the sushi tomi special roll... it's salmon and scallops on the outside and your choice of salmon, hamachi, and spicy tuna on the inside. The outside is torched with a delicious Smoky aroma. Delicious!"
67,"It has been years since I had a chance to visit.   I came to meet an ex-colleague for lunch.   I had the chirashi lunch entree.   Very fresh sushi!   Since, I came I see the front of the building had been redone and modernized. Great place if you want authentic Japanese sushi."
68,"Been meaning to try this place out and finally got to! Was a little worried as we drove by with all the people waiting out front, but the wait ended up not being too bad at all, for a wednesday night. We ordered the extra special chirashi bowl, the extra special nigiri, and the tomi roll with hamachi. Both came with miso soup and the fried shrimp head from our sweet shrimp. We also got a free braised tuna app! Loved loved loved all the food! We definitely didnt need the extra roll, but definitely worth the food coma now! This is def gonna be a new go to for sushi! Will have to try out some of the lunch/dinner combos in the future!"
69,Ordered take out on a Friday and came picked up around dinner time. There was quite a lot of people in the waitlist and I'm glad that takeout is more efficient. I got the regular sashimi (their salmon sashimi is the best!) and a Tomi special roll with spicy tuna (also very delicious). Next time I'm looking forward to have the fish liver and unagi Don!
70,"Went here on a Saturday evening and waited for about 20min. We ordered the special Chirashi, Ochazuke, beef tongue and hamachi special roll. All were very tasty, especially the Ochazuke and special roll. Some of the beef tongue was hard to chew (wish it's is smaller pieces). I like how the menu has a verity of choices and the prices are reasonable."
71,"Castro street can be quite underwhelming for it being THE street of Mountain View. I'd say Sushi Tomi is a decent place to go when in town. It's very popular even on a weekday, yet the service is quick and efficient. Food is pretty standard -- I wish the agedashi tofu was a bit crispier. The chirashi was pretty good as well, nothing out of the water though."
72,"Pretty good and very well. My friend recommended the omakase at this place. It's $55 for 10 pieces of nigiri and though it's only 10 pieces but it does fill you up. I enjoy most of the nigiri pieces except the white mackerel one. I'm not a big fan of raw mackerel and shrimp. I enjoyed the tuna, salmon, uni, crab and the fried shrimp head. Also, they don't accept reservation and there's definitely a line because it's a popular spot but if you come before 6:30pm then you should be fine. Either way, the line does go by fast."
73,"I love this place! The miso soup is tasty with bits of soft tofu and seaweed with a salty finish. The raw salmon sushi and the raw salmon sushi eggs where delicious, the rice was sticky and accompanied with it perfectly. You should also try the udon noodles. The place is super popular, so it is hard to get a seat. But the food is worth it. The service here is good, and sometimes my family and I get Japanese ice cream. The flavors are all awesome, there is green tea matcha, mango, and maybe vanilla? The ambiance is okay, it isn't so noisy, and is peaceful at the same time. I love it here! in total, I rate this a 5 star! I encourage you to visit and eat here."
74,"I am always looking for affordable good quality sushi around me!! Sushi Tomi will now be my new go-to spot on Castro for sushi! Normally I only order alaska/salmon avocado rolls and nigiri when I eat sushi, and they had my favorite types (scallop and sweet shrimp)! The roll was hefty and filled with fresh salmon, not fishy at all. I also loved the nigiri; the sweet shrimp came with the fried heads as well! All the orders were around $8 (which is a steal) and the whole meal came out to $25. The employees were SO busy with the insane amount of takeout orders they had. I dined in and service was fast. Interior is cozy but will lots of seating. Will definitely come back again!"
75,"Definitely not worth a wait and not sure why so many great reviews. The regular chirashi was disappointing. Not whole lot of fish and just lacking. The fish wasn't super fresh. The chicken teriyaki was aright, nothing special. But they do give a lot of portion of it. Take out order took about 25-30 minutes.No outdoor dining available"
76,We enjoy our special nigiri sushi.  Service was great and no wait on weekdays dinner. So few people inside we almost has to whole place to ourselves. Many people order take out. Some even eat inside their car. People are very cautious these days.I feel like price and quality is very reasonable. Parking is easy to come by. Almost empty at other castro restaurants too. I hope they survive. These are great restaurants we need to support.
77,4.5 stars.Come here again on Tue night at 6pm. No wait!! Amazing.I have sashimi from Japan $28 6kinds. Each piece are only half the size of normal piece. Tasted good.Sashimi salad $13 more sashimi than the $28 one plus a small salad and dress. Yum!Ok value and some tasty fish makes my day.
78,4.9 starsPros:1. Sushi from Japan2. Talented chefs3. All dishes are goooooood4. Free sample if you eat at sushi bar. Cons:1. The wait! You need to wait outside and it can gets cold.
79,"The bad: Always busy with line out out the door, had to share a table with another party. Super loud crowd conversations, No ambiance to speak of. The good:  Oh the scrumptious sashimi! Big, fresh chunks of delectable fish! Firm yet melt in the mouth!  Garnisheed with thinly shredded daikon and seaweed, Good to eat!Despite the negatives, the amazing sashimi made it all worthwhile. There's a reason Sushi Tomi has been a long time popular establishment in Mountain View."
80,"Visited Tomi for lunch again this afternoon, this is always my first choice of Japanese food in Mountain View ."
81,"I am so excited to know that Tomi sushi reopening . This is one of my favorite place for lunch , and we can't wait to visit it today It used to have a long waiting list during lunch , but today was kind of quick to get a table. As usual we ordered the lunch combo as follows:Tonkatsu + Tempura :  overall the lunch portion was same as before , but the tonkatsu was kind of little disappointed . The skin was crispy but inside was kind of dry. The tempura was pretty good .Tonkatsu + salmon : the salmon looks and taste yummy . The lunch combo came with the soup : The soup was salmon bone soup .  i was very disappointed about this soup , not only the was was full of salmon small bones , but also it was cold . We also ordered Salmon skin hand roll  as well. It was pretty good , the skin was crispy , hot , and the roll was wrapped well We will continue to visit this sushi place , and look forward of their improvement after the reopening . Five stars on the way !"
82,Finally got to try this place and it did not disappoint! Be prepared to wait a bit as they are usually pretty busy and there is not much seating inside. All the sushi was super fresh and we particularly enjoyed their hamachi which is always a favorite. We came on a Saturday night and waited about 45mins so come early!
83,"Best sushi around this area.Good portion, authentic, nice and kind staffs."
84,"I'd heard great things about this place and was supposed to eat here a couple years ago but accidentally went to Niji(?) instead. A friend was back home for the holidays and she wanted quality sushi. Thus, a trip to Sushi Tomi emerged!Wednesday night, place was packed despite the rainy weather! We put our name down for party of three. Waited about 25 min in the cold. Good thing I had a vest & scarf over my hoodie. Staff initially offered us the last three of four sushi bar seats but we declined. Kinda feel obligated to talk to the chefs ... Place is on the smaller side with tables pretty close together. I'm glad we sat along the window where the ceiling was higher. Scan the menu QR code and fill out their paper menu for nigiri and sushi options. No fancy schmancy special rolls here (which are my fave) but they do have classic rolls & hand rolls: rainbow roll, caterpillar roll, spider roll, bbq eel, shrimp tempura roll which is literally a fried tempura wrapped in lettuce, seaweed and rice, plus a few more. I'm not big on nigiri but we tried the $15 two piece of toro fatty tuna (seasonal price) and it blew our minds! Fresh, buttery, melt in your mouth raw fish! Now we understand why people wait to eat here. I ordered two more sets of toro nigiri after that. I had a taste of the Rainbow roll and ALL of the fish on there had the same amazing quality: salmon, regular tuna, hamachi. No weird fishy smell at all. Spider roll (4 piece) was good, large fried soft shell crab at the ends.Main eats come with soup & salad, soup had plenty of seaweed + tofu.*Combo dinner with chicken teriyaki & 6 piece gyoza, surprised they arrived on separate plates but makes sense to avoid a large bento box*Unagi DonPauline was our server and she was very attentive plus patient. Hot green tea was refilled often. They use the good stuff! I think it was even matcha because of the powder at the bottom instead of tea dregs. Convenient parking lot right across the restaurant, street parking also available. They didn't have a sign for the actual restaurant so it's easy to miss."
85,"Our favorite sushi restaurant in South Bay. Amazing quality fish and food, and decently priced too.We have never had to wait more than 15-25 minutes for a table. Service is fast and friendly. Highly recommend: their sashimi lunch/dinner, extra special chirashi bowl and the Tomi roll with hamachi. Note: they are now closed on Mondays *and* Tuesdays."
86,"No frills, local and family friendly sushi restaurant! Interior - always bustling, but the staff are extremely kind and fast even on busy weekends.We got the regular nigiri plate and every cut of fish was so fresh - I especially liked the tuna belly and salmon nigiri. The shrimp tempura roll was nice and crunchy, and the salmon roll was yummy! Sensitive stomach rating: :)) all fresh and good"
87,"This place is super busy a lot of the time and in a tucked away location on Castro but definitely worth the visit! Good: Service is super fast, we got our miso soup and salads a few minutes after we ordered.The pork katsu curry is really good too - it came out quickly and wasn't on the dinner menu but it was available to order. Definitely very tasty curry - maybe too much rice:meat ratio, but I still felt the portion sizes and value was good for the price.Their takoyaki was good too - pretty standard but always savory and tasty in my opinion. Bad:Definitely less of a fancy place, more casual and the food quality isn't the best I've had in terms of Japanese restaurants, but I still thought the food was good for the price. Overall would come again! They have a huge menu."
88,"I rarely go to sushi restaurants because I find that I can get similar food for cheaper at supermarkets. However, Sushi Tomi was worth it!I got the Tomi Special Roll with Spicy Tuna, and the seafood was really fresh! They don't skimp on the fish, and one roll was enough food for me. The Tomi Special Roll was the best compromise between a specialty dish and affordability. We came near closing on a Wednesday night, and there was still a decent number of people inside, but the wait wasn't too long. It's the perfect place to catch up with friends because you can walk down Castro Strret afterwards and grab dessert."
89,"Sushi Tomi is that perfect sushi foil to all your savor  sushi cravings.   We had a rainbow roll, California roll, and a couple of ngiri and eel rolls.Our sea fare was fresh,  light,  flavorful and satisfying.  Price point is on the higher side $$ but the rolls are perfectly executed seafood splendid!"
90,This is one of the busiest sushi restaurants that I have been to so I assumed it must be really good. It's one of the small local sushi places and locally run and operated. I enjoyed the combination dinner box with spicy tuna and California roll. Every was delicious and tasty. The service was great!I would only advise to not come hungry because the wait it 45 to 90 minutes away especially on the weekends
91,"They are always packed, and for good reason. I recommend coming within the first 30 minutes when they open to avoid longer lines. This is a good sushi staple in MV with ample parking across the street. The prices are reasonable and the fish quality is hard to beat! Only $55 for omakase (sashimi or nigiri)."
92,"Had very high hopes since there was a long line outside for lunch. Ordered the sashimi bento -- the sashimi had so much water content in the meat (especially the yellowtail; the salmon was actually not bad), so I'm pretty sure they thawed some frozen fish and slapped it in the bento box. Presentation was nice, but I wish I got some more ginger. The miso soup and the salad dressing were much too salty. The general ambiance is nice (clean), and it's hopping. Gotta say I don't see the reason why it was hopping though... but not a bad price for the food."
93,I ordered Sashimi Omakase thinking that it would be a proper Omakase style dish. How worse can it be right? After all it was the most expensive dish in the menu ($65) After receiving the plate I realized that something wasn't right. This was even worse than my wife's $32 Extra Special Nigiri. I'll never go back to this place ever again.
94,"Great food, cozy vibe, worth the wait! I am a beginning and had rainbow roll and California roll, but my buddies are pros and chose more assorted stuff including the shark cartilage appetizer. Everyone left super pleased!"
95,"Solid 3-star Japanese restaurant in Mountain View. Probably not the best place to go for authentic omakase but a decent choice if you have a group and want rolls, tempura, etc. We ordered a number of rolls (unagi, spicy tuna, salmon and avocado, rainbow roll, and caterpillar roll), and they were all decent. We also got a few nigiris which were reasonably priced compared to other Japanese restaurants in the Bay Area (ex: 2-pieces amaebi for less than $10)."
96,"my favorite japanese restaurant. fresh, yummy, good combination, nice service. there is a sushi bar."
97,"Lovely omakase. Ratio of rice was a little on the large side but nice selection and presentation. They included miso soup and fried shrimp head. Added an order of hotate since it was special from Japan. Definitely returning. Line forms by the time I got there at 5:50pm. Lots of parking right across the street, but all spaces were gone towards 7pm."
98,"I have had their sashimi several times, in store and delivery, and it is so high quality every time. The fish tastes very fresh and they cut very thick slices. Expensive but worth it if you can afford it."
99,Small sushi spot hidden away in Mountain View. Monkfish liver  along with everything else was delicious.
100,"The quality of the sushi is excellent. The fish is fresh. There is no fishy or foul taste to the fish. It melts in your mouth and is delicious. The service is also good. Surprisingly, there was no wait here when we went. Parking is also easy to find. The sushi is authentic."
101,"Food was good but service was horrendous, and I will not be back.My friend and I arrived at around 1:10pm on a weekday for lunch (not knowing their lunch hours are 11:30 - 1:30). They let us in and then informed us that we would be last call after we were seated. This immediately made us feel rushed when looking over the QR code menu (that took forever to load on our phones too).When the server came over to take our order at around 1:20pm, we asked if we could get a few more minutes and she said no. So we had to really hurry and ended up going with 3 basic sushi rolls that couldn't go wrong: salmon roll, caterpillar roll, and salmon avocado roll.Our food came out shortly after and as we were just about to start digging in, our server came by and asked us to pay right then and there... When they came back with my credit card and receipt, she immediately asked me to fill out the tip amount and sign the receipt with no regard for how we were enjoying our food or anything.We finished eating pretty quickly and hustled to get out of the restaurant because we just felt so unwelcome the entire time. The food was solid but this entire experience left such a bad taste in my mouth.Overall, I would have preferred that they tell us upfront that we would be last call, because I would just take our business one block over to Kakaroto (which has FANTASTIC service and food). Also I could not believe the audacity to have us pay immediately after receiving our food! I understand if the kitchen is closing at 1:30pm but does that also mean the cash register is closing???"
102,Yes! Looking for a fresh sushi in Bay Area while staying on budget? That's your go to! Tuna tataki is my favorite here
103,"I am a regular. I always order extra special chirashi bowl. Sushi Tomi was not the most consistent place to begin with in terms of fish quality. Unfortunately, their consistency has gone down significantly in the past one year. With 50% chance, I either get fishy uni, bland fatty tuna, or both. Today I got salmon that probably has gone bad (very strong fishy aftertaste), noticeably small portion of rice, seaweed salad, and side salad. I remember their side salad used to have at least 3 types of vegetables. For $3, I got a few pieces of lettuce (half of the salad container was the dressing container). Very disappointed.2.5/5. Rounding down hoping that my message reaches the right person."
104,"Overall good food, good service. I come here for extra special chirashi bowl. Deep fried shrimp head that comes with the bowl is very yummy."
105,"Stopped by on a Wednesday night and due to having a larger party had to wait outside for maybe 15 minutes. When you arrive you write your name down on a sheet which is nice so you can see how many parties are ahead of you. We ordered veggie tempura and gyoza as appetizers, all good but pretty standard. For sushi, we ordered a total of 8 rolls and they were brought out on a huge platter! The menu was a little more limited than I expected and hard for us to understand. We ordered our rolls via a piece of paper at the table (the rolls we got weren't on their dinner menu which was confusing). All in all, it was good sushi but nothing that blew me away. Would still recommend for a sushi night!"
106,Great spot for sushi! Popped in for an early dinner with a friend and we thoroughly enjoyed our sake dons and sake nigiri.Gets busy as dinner picks up- old school sign in on a paper pad so get here early if you're hungry!
107,"I had a fantastic time at Sushi Tomi! The experience of watching the chefs cook the food right in front of me was truly unforgettable. As a big fan of sushi, I must say that they serve some of the best sushi I've had. The presentation of the food was also impressive, and the portions were huge. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and will certainly be returning. Thank you for a great dining experience!"
108,"This is a Japanese restaurant. It's located 1 1/2 blocks east of the main street in downtown Mountain View. I have seen this place countless times over the years. Every time I drove by I saw a line outside in the street. I am not a fan of lines so I believe I ate inside only once. I never wrote a review until now.This place is closed on Tuesdays. Apparently, according to at least 2 places online, one of them being Google, the place is closed on Mondays. That was not true since I ate dinner there on Monday, the 27th of March. Also, one of the waitresses mentioned the closing day is Tuesday to the table next to us so that confirms it. Don't be mislead by the wrong information.I arrived shortly after 5PM when the business opened for dinner and the place was quiet (likely because of the wrong information on the closing day). We were politely invited to sit at a table in the back next to the window. The restaurant was quiet but within 5-10 minutes it started to fill up. However, it never got completely full while we were there.Since I've never seen it before and I like lager beers, I wanted to try a Kuronama, a variety of Dunkel lager beer brewed by Asahi. I found it on the website at the page https://tomisushi.us/sushitomi so I had to try it. When I inquired about it the waitress was lost. She did not know what I was talking about. It was eventually clear that the item is not on the menu so the online menu is outdated and it should be corrected. I settled for a 16oz Sapporo lager on draft and my girlfriend ordered a Ramune drink. We also ordered a variety of courses including yakitori skewer, saba shio (appetizer), salmon teriyaki, saba (2 nigiri pieces), white tuna tataki (8 pieces) and tempura (appetizer). Now I will focus on what I drank/ate. The Sapporo was excellent as usual. I am biased by the fact it's my all-time favourite beer but, let's face it, for a rice beer done right, it has the best balance of all lager beers: it's refreshing, crisp, clear and it's never bitter. The saba was great. It had the distinctive saltiness I am fond of. It tasted fresh and so was the white rice that accompanied the seafood. The wasabi was surprisingly fresh and it really looked green, natural and pleasing to the eye. The yakitori skewers consisted of 2 small skewers of chicken with some white onions. They were light and tasty. The saba shio consisted of 2 pieces of grilled mackerel. They had a good amount of bones but they were tasty and well prepared. The tenpura was good. It was an ensemble of 1 green pepper, 2 shrimp, 1 piece of broccoli, 2 squash, 1 carrot and, we presume, 1 piece of potato. It was nice and crispy, fresh, properly battered and tasty. The white tuna tataki was a pile of lightly seared tuna slices accompanied by a paper see-through seaweed I never seen before that came along with some brown radish and shaved vegetables (they looked like onions or something similar - I could not tell). The ensemble was sitting on a semi-dark liquid, likely soy sauce or some sort of ponzu. It was very good, light, fresh and tasty. From a standpoint of preparation, it was a work of culinary art.This restaurant likely delivers the true Japanese dining experience. The waitresses are really Japanese (I studied the language and their pronunciation is unmistakable). The food is refined and it has nuances that only a properly trained Japanese chef knows. I raise my hat to the folks that work in the kitchen: well done.If you are not an smartphone-obsessed person like me and still believe the human brain is smarter than the phone you'll have to ask for a menu. Apparently, if you don't, you have to get by by scanning a code with a phone to see the menu. Sorry: that ain't me. I like the traditional way of ordering food and I am paying for that as well. I want to flip and not scroll. I ain't no Millennial and I can survive without having to check on my phone 50 times a day. Give me a menu.All in all, the entire dinner cost me ~$91 but it was a very nice dinner for 2 people. We picked a bunch of stuff but the food and service were really good. The waitresses were very polite and Japanese-mannered which is nice, especially in this day and age that Don Henley labeled as the ""graceless age"". If you are looking for a fine Japanese dining experience you should try this place. Now I know why the place has always a line outside. 2459 reviews with 4 stars must be saying something."
109,"After everyone else raised their prices by 30~50% in Bidenflation era, Sushi Tomi has become comparatively a great value. Extra Special Sushi gets you 8 pieces of premium fish (usually including Uni or Abalone), a Maki roll and a bowl of soup for $33. That's about $4 a piece of premium Nigiri with the Maki and soup as complimentary extras. I also normally get an appetizer, finish up with an additional order of Tamago sushi and ask them to hold the soup till the end. I'll be full and out the door at $50 and change.--Remember to spend $2.50 for fresh Wasabi which is also a steal at today's prices. And, they give you a big enough serving of fresh Wasabi that I almost feel bad knowing how expensive it can be (almost $200 a pound in the US; about $80 in Japan)! Most places don't serve real Wasabi and those do won't serve you any food for less than $100.--Side Note: Sushi Tomi is not the best place if you are looking for exotic and rare fish flown in from Toyosu Japan with price being no object. There are plenty of places you can drop $200~300 for that stuff in an Omakase spread. But, what they do have is of high quality and it is serve on good sushi rice (Shari).--With the demise of Akane, Sushi Tomi has become my go to spot for the lower Peninsula. The dining environment is nothing to write home about, but the sushi should be the reason you are here!"
110,"The sushi is good but service somehow has deteriorated a LOT. The waitress seems in a hurry, with a scolding tone as if we did something to upset her. She brought us a plate of sushi, then took it away, then brought it back again without any explanation what's going on. My friend wanted to pay for the meal and asked for the check, the waitress did not understand him at first, when she learnt that my friend want to pay, she sharply shouted to correct my friend's accent, in a scolding tone again. She also declined to use my friend's credit card because the credit card does not have chip. Two star is for the food, negative experience for the service. The place used to be a nice, friendly neighborhood go to sushi place, it's unfortunate how it became what it is today"
111,I ordered a bento box and split some rolls to share with my family. The California rolls were delicious and probably the highlight for me. The tempura was good but the salmon teriyaki and spicy tuna rolls were lacking for me.
112,This used to be my go to sushi place until they made adjustments to the menu recently. Quality has degraded so much! Both quality and portion!
113,"Pleasantly surprised by this sushi joint. Good sushi and decent price, would recommend! Came here at 5pm and the restaurant filled up fast. All of the nigiri pieces in the extra special nigiri set was fresh. Good fish to rice ratio. Came with miso soup which was nice. They also deep fried the amaebi head which is a must and they did a great job with it. It was properly coated with batter and deep fried enough so that it's actually crunchy. Definitely will come back!"
114,"If in Mountain View, head to Sushi Tomi! It's been a while since I've grabbed sushi here, so it was definitely a treat!Current dinner hours are 5:00pm-8:00pm. I called at 6:15pm to place a to go order and the wait was already 1.5 hrs, so my ETA for pick up was 7:50pm. It was a cold winter Friday night during Covid... and while all the surrounding streets were dark and empty, Sushi Tomi had a long line for pick up orders. That just shows how busy this place is, even during Covid and just for take out orders!The staff was quick and super organized. I arrived at 7:45pm and only had to wait in line for 10 minutes. When I got to the front, my order was ready for pick up and I was on my happy way.Ordered:1. Special Sashimi Dinner (14 piece Sashimi)2. Order of Amaebi (2 pieces)The sashimi was fresh and delicious. The cuts were thick and melted in your mouth. I savoured each bite and slowly enjoyed the meal. Very satisfied with the variety of sashimi! The amaebi was larger than expected. The shrimp meat was sweet and so tender. However, the fried shrimp heads were disappointing. It was fried with tempura batter (normally not the case at other restaurants) and was extremely soggy when I opened up my dinner.I enjoyed the meal overall and would definitely be back if I'm in the area. Next time, I'll call once they open, now that I know how high in demand Sushi Tomi is!"
115,"Found thru Yelp! Did not disappoint....Miso soup, Spicy Tuna Roll, Sashimi Special, great texture and flavors ...enjoy!!!!"
116,"Consistently fresh, delicious, and well-priced sushi. This is the most authentic and best sushi place I've found in the Sunnyvale/Mountain View area during the shelter-in-place. I've never eaten inside the restaurant but the food quality is excellent.Recommendations:- Spicy tuna roll: Cheap, filling, delicious, and a staple. You can order the other more expensive rolls to try the menu but this is a great filler to get you full- Tomi roll: Another fresh roll with thick cuts of scallop- Caterpillar roll: Avocado and unagi (eel)- Uni: Self-explanatory, amazing- Toro: Fatty tuna sushi which is delicate, rich, and flavorful. Just FYI it falls apart on the drive so if you can eat it right away, eat it right awayEven with shelter-in-place and takeout only, this place is PACKED and gets backed up easily. Plan ahead, call as soon as they open, and expect to pick up your food in 35-45 minutes."
117,"Sushi Tomi is a great place to visit if you're ever craving authentic Japanese food. The quality of their raw fish is amazing and all of their cooked food is delicious as well. I highly recommend the following:- Tomi Special Roll: This roll is slightly seared on top and you can choose the type of fish that is used (I recommend Hamachi). The roll comes with a mild spicy Mayo sauce and some onions/sprouts that gives it an amazing freshness. This is such a creamy and delicious roll and it practically melts in your mouth due to the freshness of the fish.- Combination Bento: You can choose any two options, even two proteins, which makes this such a great deal! I like choosing the teriyaki beef and teriyaki salmon - both of which are cooked to perfection- Any of their sashimi, sushi, or nigiri optionsNote: This place gets packed on weekends so make sure to go early if possible (or be prepared to wait)."
118,Great place for sushi. I was amazed at their culinary expertise. I was skeptical to try this but amazed by their quality and taste.
119,"My bf picked this place for dinner on a Friday night based off the 2000 reviews. It was busy but at 5:30pm, didn't take long to seat us at all which is always nice after a work week. Staff we're quick and efficient. But honestly, I'm not sure what the hype is. It was okay, not bad at all, but truly just okay. However for just okay I thought it was overpriced. The menu is very modest and simple. It's a safe choice if you aren't picky and you live close by. But if you're traveling a distance to try a new restaurant or want good, satisfying, fresh sushi, this ain't it."
120,This place is great. It doesn't hurt that it's fairly local to us. Only caveat is that pickup orders do take a little while... it's really just a matter of adjusting your timing expectations.
121,"Never coming back here again. I pointed and ordered the kampachi kama. When then check came it was hamachi kama (which is more expensive). I brought it to the first waitress and she asked ""well... which fish did you eat?"" I replied ""I don't know..."" I can't tell the difference between a cooked fish collar. And she just walked away. My waitress that was helping us that night came back and all she said is ""sorry about that"" and did not even fix the issue. Be sure to double check your order. They will give you a more expensive item than what you ordered. There is better quality sushi elsewhere with better service. The food is edible but not amazing. Alot of the appetizers did not come with sauce. Only soy sauce was available. And a lot of the items were also just topped with thin layers of onions for plating? But it just made it more messy."
122,"Great sushi and delicious, authentic Japanese food. Sushi Toni is our family's favorite Japanese restaurant! Highly recommend!"
123,"Sushi Tomi is a nice and cozy place - went at around 6PM and there was already starting to be a line up outside. We got the special nigiri and special sashimi dinner, which came out to be around $80. I would not recommend getting these two in combination since they were all pretty fatty fish and got a little to much at the end. Not sure if it was too much fattiness or not fresh fish but I think both of us got a little bit of food poisoning after this meal :("
124,"Very friendly staffs, food was amazing and portions were good. We had our family reunion here and everyone enjoy the time here. The Chirashi has good assortment of fish!"
125,"How did I not find out about this earlier? This place is definitely worth the hype had money in Mountain View!Even during during the pandemic, Sushi Tomi still delivers the same quality food you'd expect at this hidden gem.One of their most popular items is the Extra Special Chirashi. After seeing pictures of this from yelp I knew I had to try it myself. The chirashi was pretty loaded with plenty of fresh fish and was delightful from start to finish. I also ordered that plus the Tomi Special Roll with hamachi. This roll is pretty good with the sauce that gets added to it on the side.The only downside to this restaurant is the wait. Dinner time usually has a lot of people at the door, though it's not as bad as it was pre-pandemic. If you get there at opening, or close to when it opens, you shouldn't have much trouble getting seated quickly. The tables and the space of the restaurant in general isn't huge, so I wouldn't bring a large party to it. However, it's perfect for 1-2 people to dine in."
126,"The food was excellent but the service has never been so bad. Had a party of 5 and the waitress takes our order. 2 of us want iced tea with lemon, 2 want beer, and we all want water. Waitress then says to us ""I can't do that because the table is too small"". I look at the table and look at her and I'm completely confused what she means by this. The tea comes out in a bottle and we have to pour it ourselves, weird but no big deal. She forgot multiple times different orders afterwards and everything just felt so unorganized from start to finish. I had brought important clients to dinner and I talked the place up so much, I was embarrassed by the end.I left a 10% tip. A different waitress came up to us after with the check in hand and asked, ""what happened is everything okay?"" I told her it was a bad experience, she then said ""well this is a big table I don't understand why you're not tipping?"". THE MOST ENTITLED APPROACH EVER. I honestly can forgive the waitress for being busy and overwhelmed, and I left a small tip, but to demand a big tip is extremely entitled."
127,"Guys, their Extra special Chirashi is the best! I usually get one every Friday. It can totally cheer me up and relax my soul!"
128,"When I need a self-esteem boost, I go to Sushi Tomi and get an *extra special* chirashi. Seriously though, Sushi Tomi makes you feel so special. The quality is so good it feels as though you've teleported to Japan.My family has been a long-time fan of Sushi Tomi, and the food has been consistently amazing over the years. We routinely visited weekends, when the staff open the doors before the official opening time because to help prevent the wait from getting too long. During COVID era, they remain open for take-out, continue their specials and regular menu, and make quarantine life a better for all of us. Everything is as good as I remember, except sans the green tea they had for dine-in which was excellent.They don't have online ordering (which I've gotten cautious about because of all the profit that goes to third-party apps), but phone ordering is easy. It's nice that they remind customers of the MV location and quote realistic wait times. The menu is on their website, and I would suggest asking about the daily specials which is posted on a board outside. Lately, they've been offering a bento omakase which features a mix of sashimi, izakaya fare, and staples.My go-to is the LUNCH COMBO because there are so many great options (including sashimi!) and the price is reasonable. My fiance likes to get the TOMI BENTO, which is an indulgent 4-item combo and lots of food.The sashimi is fresh and the cuts are thick--it's not like those super bouge sushi places where a bite of fish costs $$$, but definitely exceeds expectations for semi-picky, amateur sushi enthusiasts. The CHIRASHI or NIGIRI are always good choices, and very photogenic. With regards to regular vs special vs extra special, it depends on how fancy you want your sashimi to be. The TAMAGO is on point too; they nail the fluffy, airy texture.Sometimes they have a nigiri + sashimi special which is my favorite. Although it turned out somewhat pricey (I essentially tried it by accident on a phone order), in retrospect it's a good deal because it's essentially a fish feast.I was sad when the hole-in-the-wall curry place in Downtown MV closed down, but Tomi's KATSU CURRY does a good job satisfying Japanese curry cravings. The katsu is crispy and the curry has oomph. Portions are huge too and easily lasts two meals.When I'm in the mood for something simple, I get their DONBURI. The chicken teriyaki has a delightfully light glaze, and the oyako don is reminiscent of brunch. Overall, I am always satisfied with Sushi Tomi because they make traditional Japanese food so well (no gimmicks, just good honest fish), at reasonable prices, and enough rotating specials to keep me hooked."
129,"It seems like I can never get the name right... Tomi Sushi or Sushi Tomi?  In any case, you always know, it's the Japanese restaurants with the mundane names in a small, crowded venue of traditional wooden fixtures that turn out to be the best.The sashimi quality is probably one of the better ones in Norcal, and they stay true to authenticity--they have good honest maki, not just an entire page of colorful deep-fried piles of sushi swimming in sauce.  When at a place with decent sashimi, there is no doubt that the chirashi is a must-try: they have regular, special, and extra special.  Seeing that I am not a fan of fish roe and prefer the basic stuff, I get REGULAR CHIRASHI ($17) and I am ecstatic--chirashis are shrinking in many restaurants into well-manicured little displays of sashimi, but Sushi Tomi gives you a no-frills, no-skimping generous box of sushi rice topped with several thick slices of fish.If you want something fancier, they do have the TOMI SPECIAL ROLL ($13.40) which is quite delicious.  I think it would have been more delicious if it came with a description.  From my experience, I would describe it as a roll with a choice of spicy tuna, salmon, or hamachi filling, wrapped in slightly burnt rice and topped with seared albacore.  There's a side of spicy orange sauce and a beautiful garnish of onions and sprouts--it has all the elements of modern cuisine, yet it is not overdone and still has the high-quality sashimi.If raw fish does not fancy you, the entrees are good as well.  CHICKEN TERIYAKI and CALIFORNIA ROLLS don't sound all too exciting, but here it's simple comfort food.Lastly, be sure to come for the amazing LUNCH SPECIALS, (secret: even on weekends!)  Many times there is sashimi, the same delicious Tomi Sushi sashimi, made extremely affordable if you don't mind getting the less aesthetic cuts of the odds and ends.The complimentary hot green tea is quite comforting, especially when served in a classic Tomi Sushi mug.  It's fairly plain an a fairly oldschool shade of pale blue, but it's exactly these quaint little details that give good Japanese restaurants their charm."
130,"My first impression: I ordered the dinner bento and thought this was just a mediocre place where they give you a lot of food but also charge a lot.  Then I discovered the chirashi and this instantly turned into my favorite sushi place in the South Bay.The sashimi is very fresh (matches up to my SoCal standards), and the cuts for the chirashi are generous.  I was especially impressed by the 3 huge pieces of tuna.  The sushi rice is sprinkled with nori and is extremely flavorful, unlike most other places that get lazy and give you mediocre rice.There are 3 types of chirashi: regular, special, and extra special.  Each one gets more expensive, and what makes them more special is the type of sashimi.  The pricier ones include roe and sea urchin, which I actually don't like, so I prefer the regular one ($17).  May not be ""special"", but it's affordable and absolutely delicious.  Also, the wasabi is on the strong side, so just a word of caution not to use too much!"
131,one of the freshest chirashi i've ever had! the menu variety was great for people who aren't crazy about raw fish as well. definitely will be back!
132,"The food was Ok. The katsu curry lunch was nothing special. The sashimi lunch was solid. The service was horrendous. I asked my initial waitress for the daily lunch special and she said ""yes and pointed to a wall"" but the wall didn't have any signage of the daily lunch special. Then she quickly left. I think asked a second waitress regarding the daily lunch special, she grumbled something and all I understood was ""katsu curry"" and she said ""and they all cost differently"" she also ran off very fast. The waitress who took my order looked like she was going to kill me as I said ""daily lunch special"" and then I specified which one I wanted. I am not coming here again."
133,It was good at first but after a while of going here the portions got smaller and the wait time for food was extended. I waited almost 30 minutes for my Lunch Combo just to find out it had lass portions.
134,"I ordered toro sushi as a ""market price"", it was nothing special for me with very special price haha, My bad, I shouldn't check the price verbaly."
135,"Not too far from my house. Long waiting as always. Went there for a few times. Good food, nice service."
136,GET HERE EARLY!! THIS PLACE PACKS UP FAST! It is worth the wait. All of their food was delicious and a generous amount. We brought the whole family and the portion of the dinner bentos were more than enough for the kiddos. The wife and I had sashimi and various rolls. All were hands down . No doubt coming back here again.
137,"From the moment we walked in, we were warmly greeted and made to feel at home. The atmosphere of the restaurant is lovely, with beautiful decor and a relaxing ambiance that is perfect for enjoying a meal with friends or family.But the real star of the show was the food. The sushi was simply out of this world - the fish was incredibly fresh and expertly prepared, with each piece melting in our mouths and bursting with flavor. The variety of rolls and dishes was also impressive, with something for everyone on the menu.Recommend to everyone!"
138,"It's a really great place if you want to share lots of different side dishes and Japanese tapas. I had a party of 9 and everyone loved it, great service, food was delicious. Definitely ask for the daily specials and it did not disappoint. Line is long so be prepared to wait!"
139,I ordered fish soup to go for $20 I got a cabbage  soup with noodle two small pieces of fish .
140,"Good meal, good service. Anagi was not fresh but otherwise good. Long line . Place is clean  and busy."
141,We tried coming here during the summer but they were doing take out only. They are back to having indoor seating. The freshest sushi I've had and everything we ordered was tasty.
142,"2+ years later and STILL amazing! The quality of the sushi is fresh, and you can never go wrong with the extra special chirashi! There's still a wait time during dinner hours, and you need your whole party present to be seated. Definitely worth the wait!"
143,"Definitely one of my ""go-to"" spots for fresh sushi. Came here with a small group of 4 on a Sunday night. They don't take reservations, but I think we beat the dinner rush by getting there at 6pm so we only had to wait for 5-10 min. They don't have very many seating areas. We ordered the fried soft shell crab for the table. It had great flavor and was fried to perfection. For myself I had the extra special chirashi bowl. Definitely a large amount of food and thick slices of fish to satiate any belly. The service was good, but we had to ask for water refills a few times. All in all an excellent dinner every time."
144,"3.5 STARSCOVID-19 TAKEOUT With COVID-19, there's been SO much conflicting info going around. One of them: If you get takeout, microwave the f*ck out of it. Mmm, nothing like paying $$$ for sushi that turns into cat food after nuking it.I guess I've been living on the wild side for the last 2 months because I've been getting sushi takeout almost weekly and eating it...raw. So far, so good. Not even the Hershey squirts. Sushi Tomi has been sitting on my bookmarks for years. Every time I'm in the area (pre-covid), there's always a line so I never visited. However, I saw that they're open during this pandemic for takeout so I was excited to finally try their Extra Special Chirashi. Check their website for daily specials. I called in my dinner order ahead of time and was quoted a 5:10 PM pickup time.When I arrived a little before 5:10 PM, my order was ready to go (no line). There's a table blocking the entrance to the restaurant with hand sanitizer available for customer use. All staff wore their masks properly except one person in the kitchen. It wasn't on the online menu but I asked if they had Gyutan: Grilled Beef Tongue available and they did! I'm so glad they did because it was my favorite part of the meal. The Gyutan (5 pc - $8.50) was well-seasoned, beefy, and tender with charred smoky edges. Sorry, no pic.For my main, I ordered the Extra Special Chirashi ($31). It's the reason why I originally bookmarked Sushi Tomi. Unfortunately, it was a mixed bag. The fish was fresh but varied in quality. The highlights were the chu toro, hamachi toro, sake, and uni. The lowlights were maguro (so dry), amaebi, and ikura (hella salty!).Perhaps it was a bad batch but the sushi rice was below average. Or, maybe it's the brand they use; as others have stated, the quality doesn't seem up to par. The texture was off (overcooked) and it wasn't seasoned enough. Oh well, at least it saved me some carbs.Overall, it was a decent meal (sans the rice) and I'm glad to finally knock this off my list without having to wait in a long line for it. If you've been deterred by the long lines at Sushi Tomi, now is the best time to visit and support this small local restaurant!"
145,Have to wait over 20 mins in the line for lunch at weekdays... won't do that again. They have good fatty tuna but their uni was kinda disappointing. Unagi was tasty and will probably try their other lunchbox next time. Seaweed salad was one of the worst that I have ever had...
146,"I definitely underestimated the portion sizes. Next time I'll be ordering more. This place was recommended to me by some friends, and I'm really glad they  told me about it. I really liked their sushi quality, and I will be back!They're only doing takeout at the moment."
147,We ordered for pick up on Saturday Night. We called at 5:30 and they told us to pick up at 6:30. My husband and I both got the Omakase with 10 piece nigiri. The fish was fresh and the quality was good. It really was satisfying to have sushi again. I've been craving sushi but was scared to order something that I couldn't reheat myself. I'm glad I made the plunge. The food was that good. I don't know if it's all the over eating I've done at home during SIP but I did find the portion a bit lacking. It was sooo goood though. The omakase also came with miso soup.
148,"One of the most authentic sushi experiences. Traditional, simple and the highest quality fish from Tsukiji, other parts of Japan and the world. Sit at the bar and get an authentic experience ordering from Chef."
149,"4.5/5If you work in the Mountain View area, chances are you will here Sushi Tomi come up when considering an outing with a group. Sushi Tomi is, in my experience, one of the more consistent sushi restaurants in the area. Their menu is super simple and does not have many inventive rolls you see in other restaurants. The items are competitively priced in my experience. The place was always super busy pre-pandemic during lunch and dinner hours. So, if you are looking to eat and are flexible with your time, I suggest coming towards the earlier or later end of those hours (assuming things go back to normal). During the pandemic, I thought the restaurant did an adequate job at meeting the various CDC guidelines.As for what I order, I usually get the Tomi Special roll as it a personal favorite of mine. For the nigiri, the slab of fish often is more generous than places I have visited in the area. This is the same for the sashimi. There has only been one time in which I thought the fish quality was stale out the handful of times I have came by for lunch/dinner/takeout. Service is usually spot on when dine-in was an option (not sure if it is now-a-days). If I ask for something like low sodium soy sauce or wanted to put in an extra order, it would come immediately or be appropriately queued up."
150,"Best sushi I've ever had for the last 24 years of my life. Fast service, fast energy, AMAZING food. I will always come here for my sushi needs - takeout is a great option if there is a long wait, which on weekends, there sometimes/usually is. I love it!"
151,"I LOVE SUSHI TOMItheir fish is always so good and the Tomi Roll with hamachi is a MUST. this is my favorite sushi place in the bay so far and I find myself coming here at least once a week. Usually for takeout though, because it's so popular so there is usually a wait."
152,"Great lunch special! Big portion and decent price, but be careful that it gets really packed during lunch hours, so make sure to call ahead for to go orders or come earlier. I ordered the two items bento which came with rice, salad, soup, and I chose pork cutlet katsu and sashimi for the two entrees. All items were very delicious. Very yummy!"
153,Nice Sushi place. The Caterpillar Roll and Chicken Teriyakiare both really tasty. Customer service was good the staff is friendly. Overall a nice atmosphere and a good experience.
154,"No frills, super solid fresh sushi. Probably the best in the area. They've been open for take out since the pandemic started and are still dishing out excellent quality fish. Most recently, I was super happy to see daily specials that included fresh Hokkaido scallops and Uni. The lunch sashimi and sushi specials are always a great deal and a nice variety."
155,"I've been a huge fan of Sushi Tomi for, I believe, at least 5 years, maybe even 10! For as long as I can remember, its a popular place for lunch, a really popular place for dinner. I come here for the fresh fish, the sashimi, and the nigiri but their other dishes are also delicious.Favorites at Sushi Tomi are the regular chirashi bowl and ankimo. I haven't had ankimo in a long time (I hope they still have it!) and since the pandemic, I have only ordered out and not dined in. They do not have outdoor seating but recently renovated (at least their outside facade) and it looks nice but still familiar.I have ordered chirashi to go (delicious). My favorite thing that I've ordered to-go is the pork katsu donburi. There was SO MUCH FOOD (clearly I am a fan of leftovers) and it was delicious. It definitely fed me for a few meals.The staff is really friendly and they do remember you if you are a regular. Happy that Sushi Tomi is still around for some seriously legit Japanese food."
156,"Would give them 4.5/5 stars if i could! Very good sushi and sashimi, but it wasn't the best i've had. It's a very straight forward, fish focused sushi place -- which is my personal favorite. We got the special sashimi, rainbow roll, spicy salmon, and a deep fried roll.The fish was good and thick cuts! The spicy salmon and rainbow roll were my favorites. The fried roll was okay, but i don't think i'd get it again. Make sure you allot an hour or so for waiting and pick up. They are getting lots of good business so there could be a wait! Phone orders only."
157,"The place is almost always near-empty when I've gone in.  Here's why...For a place so perennially empty, you'd think service would not be a problem.  It's a big problem, however.  This past week, my server (a tall, dark-haired young man) required multiple requests for more water, more wasabi, more water, and of course, the bill.  He proves the point that some people should NEVER be waiters.  He was awkward around the table, seemed confused about what he needed to do next, and oddly, dropped the plates on the table with a strangely loud ""thonk"".The food is edible, but messy on the plate.  By definition, sushi should have a colorful and neat appearance.  However, many of the orders were falling apart by the time they made it to my table.  Three stars at least for promptness.But the service.....zero stars."
158,Go here for the very good sushi.  However I had the combo plate with beef teriyaki and tempura.  Yuk!! The beef was tough to chew and the tempura was dripping with oil.  Shushi Tomi... you should be embarrassed for serving such poor quality.
159,"Nice sushi place. The food is fresh and tasty. Service is good. Whenever I visit I like to order the Dragon Roll, Rainbow Roll and Salmon Sashimi. Overall I enjoy coming here."
160,I have read all the great reviews that this Sushi place has and wanted to give it a try. I had the Spicy Tuna and Rainbow rolls together with some seaweed salad. Everything was very good I really enjoyed it. They have quite a few options on their menu and I'm planning on tasting other rolls when I come back here again.
161,"When I lived in Mountain View years ago, Sushi Tomi was my go-to sushi restaurant; I ordered from it at least twice per month. Back then, it was relatively unknown since it's a few blocks off of Castro Street. These days, there's almost always a long wait -- people are waiting outside on the sidewalk, regardless of lunch or dinner. I've moved away so only get back to Sushi Tomi about once per year. On a recent visit, I discovered that the quality, variety, and service are all still excellent. Luckily, some things never change.There's a wide variety of non-sushi and appetizers to try. The Nbeyaki udon has chicken, vegetables and egg. If you like udon, you can also try Inaniwa -- it's thinner and smoother than the traditional style. The fried soft shell crab is also quite good. By contrast, the gyoza is only ok.It's tough to review sushi/sashimi, other than to say Tomi's is very fresh. I'm a fan of the sashimi dinner, although the contents have changed over the years. The Tomi special roll allows you to choose hamachi, salmon or white tuna; it's topped with a scallop which the sushi chefs sear with a torch. Yum.Some places focus on unusual rolls. That's not really Tomi's gig; they mostly have standard ones. I've had more than my fair share of spider rolls here.I still enjoy Sushi Tomi but it's not my go-to place as the wait is just too long."
162,Our favorite Japanese resto! Everything is sooo delicious and fresh! we ordered for take out and everything was perfect!
163,"Visited this place for the first time today . Heard tons of good things about it and wanted to see what the hype was about . Paid $70 for sushi that didn't taste like anything. There is nothing unique about the rolls. A sushi roll composed of lettuce , shrimp tempura and rice is $16 dollars... even the nigiri wasn't fresh ... definitely not worth it . Not sure why there is a line out the door. Will not come back. There is definitely better sushi joints in the area."
164,"One of the best Sushi restaurants in Mountain View, if not the South Bay.  While a bit pricier than most, the consistent quality of the fish is superior.  We typically like to sit at the abolishing bar for the best experience to interact with the sushi chefs, share a shot or two of sake and learn (for example) about the difference in quality between blue-fin, big eye and other varieties of tuna.  We tried maguru, sake, hamachi and all were buttery and melt in your mouth fresh.  We also tried their agadashi tofu which was also very nice in that the coating was not gelatinous as other restaurants.  Yes it's expensive and yes, you'll wait in line, but it's worth it.  Why only 4 stars?  They need to get hooked up with a modern waiting system.  Putting your name on a list and then waiting outside in the cold and rain is so yesterday!!"
165,"Not sure what it is about this place, but it continues to impress me.  I've eaten at Joy, Niji, Kopi, and other highly rated Sushi joints in MTV and this one ranks as my favorite.  For me, it's all about the quality of the fish and rice.  All the rest is standard fair (wasabi, ginger, soy, etc).  I got the usual, Hamachi, Sake, Unagi, Maguro and this time, tried the bluefin tuna which was spectacular.  The fish simply melts in your mouth."
166,"They get their fish supply from the fish market in Japan daily.  So that being said, it should be super fresh and good quality.  I didn't partake in the nigiri, but the SO has never been disappointed with this choice here.I ordered the tonkatsu meal for dinner and it was a HUGE portion, which also included the miso soup and salad.  A pretty good value at $16.50!  The tonkatsu was legit, but nothing mind blowing.We also shared the super bomb roll (very spicy tuna with spicy sauce, deep fried).  This was the letdown of the meal.  The fish tasted slightly ""off"", but was masked with a lot of sriracha (both mixed in the tuna and in the sauce on top).  Also, for those of you who are heat-adverse, they aren't kidding with the description mentioning it being spicy multiple times!   It really creeps up on you at the end!Service was fine.  I really don't get what all the hype is about at this place.    No reservations.  I wouldn't wait a long time to dine here again."
167,Taste was good but not very fresh though. There's a long waiting line. Need to arrive earlier if don't want to waitr
168,"We're not joking when we said we're willing to drive up from LA just for sushi tomi. It's very rare to dine at sushi restaurants that offer fresh seafood at such reasonable prices these days. The sashimi cuts are thick and melt in your mouth. All the chirashi selections are similar and comparable. The sushi rice is just as thoughtfully made. Try it, it'll make you feel grateful to be alive."
169,"Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. Venue could not be any more perfect.Place isn't that big but we arrived at 7pm on a Saturday night and there was a table ready for us (note that everyone in the party must be present to be seated).Place was packed but all the servers are fast so you get your food quickly.We ordered a bunch of sushi as well as a couple udon soups.Highlights: the uni. The UNI! Something about the texture and taste of the uni that just melts in my mouth and makes me feel like the luckiest guy in the world. It's so good.I enjoyed the saba and unagi as well. Fish portions are large on top of the nigiris.Overall, would like to come back. Place is perfect for a special celebration."
170,Nice sushi place with very good customer service and a friendly and welcoming staff. Fresh delicious sushi that is well made. The place is great for dinner and lunch. We like to order takeout. The food is always ready on time and well prepared.
171,One of the best sushi spots in the bay! Best place to get fresh fish and the authentic Japanese experience!
172,Great sushi love going here I've been going there for long time their sushi is great highly recommend
173,"AMBIANCE//Tiny place. Tables and bars.SERVICE//There's a wait...even on weeknights! But thankfully they have hot tea outside which was still hot! And exactly what I wanted to prime me for a meal. Most of the servers are older middle aged gentle asian women. The service was good, they seated us quickly and they asked us for drinks right away. And when last call came around at least three different servers asked us if we wanted anything else before last call, which I think we nice. FOOD//Try the chef's recommendations if you can! They post it on a whiteboard by the hostess! My hubby always takes a picture of it before we get seated.California Roll - I know, I know, why go to a nice sushi place and get a California Roll? This is like a palate cleanser. Its to prime you for the next piece of delicious expensive fish and to remind you how rich and delicious it is. It provides a nice contrast and slows down the meal and makes those delicious nigiri pieces last so much longer. And it fills you up, so you don't go to McDonalds afterwards.Deep fried Soft shell crab - This comes with a delicious and much needed dipping sauce. Because its deep fried it can be greasy but the dipping sauce, whatever it is has some acid that cuts through it. I get this for the same reason I order a california roll. To provide a contrast to the nigiri, complements the freshness of nigiri with the fried crisp and crunch of the crab. Variety in textures! This also comes with some cabbage/lettuce and some minced radish. Yummy! Small Octopus lidako - Same reason as soft shell crab, but this time with the chewy bits of octopus! So goood! This we needed to request lemon to give the acid we needed. I wish I had some spicy kewpie mayo! Tomi Special - This is a DELICIOUS roll. Salmon inside, salmon outside. It practically tasted like nigiri with avocado! Yum! And the orange sauce was yummyBlue fin tuna combo - Fatty Tuna and Akami, yummmmy. The fatty tuna was very delicious! Very crisp flavor of the sea without the fishy taste!Salmon combo - King Salmon and Salmon Belly - The king salmon melted in my mouth! So good! The salmon belly was rich and very fatty!Seared Salmon belly - The sear totally changes the flavor from fatty clean flavor to a smokey roasted flavor. So good!!Hotate - Fresh and very very tender. So good. SUMMARY///Will I come back? Yes! Yes!Is this place expensive? $70 per person...this includes tip.What will I order next? Chirashi? Probably just to see what all the hubbub is about!"
174,"Consistent taste, good quality sushi. Wait times for takeout orders get long. This is the best you can get in Mountain View"
175,"Sushi Tomi is the best in the Bay Area! I love coming to this place. There's always a long line in front, so be patient. The sushi is so tasty and fresh. We love all of their rolls. My favorite is the spicy tuna and salmon skin roll. We also tried the Hamachi Kama which was very tasty too, however fatty. The complimentary hot tea is also worth a mention - so good. The prices are high but very worth coming here."
176,"Best sushi in Mountain View, no question. The sushi and rolls were fantastic. They were pretty busy when we went, but that's expected because they're so good. The food was amazing and the service was excellent.The fish is fresh and flavorful, their spicy tuna is one of my favorites and I can't get enough of them.Would definitely recommend trying this place out."
177,Great food and services. The price is about right. Love the sushi very fresh and good portion. If you looking for good sushi and reasonable price. Please pick sushi tomi in Mountain View :).
178,"Sushi Tomi is my favorite Japanese restaurant in the Mountain View area. I always order the dinner combination with beef sukiyaki and vegetable tempura, and the food is always fresh and flavorful. The portions are generous, and I normally have trouble finishing all the food. In normal times, there is usually a long wait time to get a table, but with the current severe COVID-19 restrictions, the restaurant is only offering take out orders. That doesn't make it any easier, as it can be difficult to get through to them on the phone. On New Year's Eve, I attempted to call right when they opened for dinner at 5 PM but had to keep redialing for 15 minutes before I got through. They initially quoted a preparation time of 1 hour and 15 minutes, but because I only ordered one item, they reduced it to 20 minutes. There was also a line outside to pick up the order, and it took about 15 minutes there too. So you still need to be patient and persistent to get your food. But it's worth it!"
179,"One of my favorite sushi spots in the Bay Area. Everything is super fresh! Always got the Special Nigiri platter and a couple of rolls to complement. Dragon roll was a little smaller than what I'm used to. But the Unagi is amazing! Super tender and melts in your mouth. I came on a Thursday afternoon and only waited 10 minutes. Awesome service and great sushi, I will definitely be back again and again."
180,"Sushi Tomi is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in the Bay Area. Back in the day, you'd have to place your name far in advance and wait for hours. I think it's similar now, except you can just pick up later. I love getting the extra special chirashi bowl that comes with uni. This always makes me full and as much as I love the rice, it's the last thing I'll finish if we got some yummy apps!You really can't go wrong with anything else on the menu. I like the Mountain View location a lot better than the San Jose location though. Can't wait until I can come back in person when it's safe to."
181,This place was absolutely amazing. Love the food. And they have gluten free soy sauce as well.
182,"Most authentic sushi I have ever had.  Amazing toro, hamachi, oysters, etc... get there early or you will be waiting.  Get the Tomi special roll!  It's all good actually"
183,Longtime neighborhood favorite. Still have a regular lunch date with a friend here every few months. Bring my daughter here whenever she is in town to visit. The sushi selections are quite varied in addition to the usual mainstays. I always enjoy biting the heads off the shrimp tempura.
184,"Don't know why I haven't written a review but it's over due. Good food and worth the wait. Plenty of small dishes for appetizer. Agedashi tofu: different twist with grated ginger, fish flakes,green onions over tofu and sauce. The ginger surprisingly complemented the taste. Salmon oigiri: grill rice ball with salmon filling. Best thing is that the rice has its own taste and it wasn't just white rice. Hamachi kana: collar bone with good flavor and good meat texture. So flavorful. The rolls were ok. See picture. Felt they were small but I guess that let you try more variety. Just got pretty standard roll with the dragon roll, spider roll, & shrimp tempura roll and rainbow roll. Fish did taste fresh. Let's just say it was worth my 30 min wait."
185,"Long wait times for poor service and food. They need more servers to accommodate the amount of customers they squeeze into the restaurant. Waitresses ignored our requests and cleaned tables instead--leaving us very uncomfortable. Because of lacking service, waiting times between entrees left us confused. Ingredients were fresh but lacked any seasoning and flavor. Inconsistent variations in flavor between dishes, ex. watery/unseasoned salmon vs. over salted (and somehow undercooked) karaage. Awkward waiting times coupled with subpar food had us leaving the restaurant early with leftovers, still hungry but not hungry enough to eat this food."
186,"My wife and i have been fans of Sushi Tomi for a while now, and have often ordered their lunch specials which are delicious and refreshing. Unfortunately, our latest experience have seen a significant drop in quality that was rather disappointing.We ordered the beef teriyaki lunch set + sushi/sashimi combo (4p sushi, 5p sashimi, 3 california rolls). Given that the combo was 27.90, i was surprised it only contained salmon / tuna / cooked shrimp and none of the more special fishes. While the fish soup was excellent, the raw fish did not taste fresh and was not the quality we've come to expect from Tomi over the years. To make things worse, the beef teriyaki (one of our go-tos) was extremely tough and overcooked, unlike the tender and juicy offering we've enjoyed here before.I really hope this was a one-time occurrence, but we will probably start giving other sushi restaurants in downtown Mountain View a try. Two stars for old times sake."
187,"Sushi Toni has fresh, delicious rolls. The salmon was very fresh and great quality. Unlike other sushi places around, it is not overpriced. While the menu is somewhat more limited than others, if you order something they're likely to make it for you. I would definitely recommend. The only complaints I have is that they're closed on Mondays and Tuesdays and the smaller menu. I will add that I have never eaten there so I can't speak to the ambiance."
188,"Easily my favorite restaurant in downtown Mountain View. Everything about this place is just amazing. I'm surprised they aren't a 1 Michelin star restaurant, because their service and food quality is so far ahead of everything else around here. My go-to order is tako sashimi, maguro sashimi, a side of rice, miso soup, and a salad. Of course raw fish is an acquired taste, but they also make excellent nigiri (california, spicy tuna, etc.) and other non-fish containing items such as their tonkatsu-kuri for those not as accustomed to Japanese cuisine. There is another location in San Jose, but it doesn't hold the same ambience as the one here in Mountain View. This place is so special to me, I almost feel like I should keep it a secret. I usually only come here with a beautiful woman, ready to spend $150+ for dinner on a beautiful evening. This place is overflowing with elegance."
189,"This place is consistently wonderful. The fish is always fresh. Sit down service was always rushed because they always had a line out the door, but they were still friendly.The rolls have very good ingredients, but are not the most well formed, we usually get a few but really come here for the nigiri.During covid we got food to go. It's never quite as good after a car ride, but we often took it to the closest park we could and it was still some of the best sushi we ever had."
190,"Fabulous fish, good rolls, friendly but rushed service. This place seems like it's always packed with a line out the door but it is well worth the wait."
191,Pretty good sushi place around town. I always call in in advance and go pick up to save time and also because of COVID. The lady at the restaurant is always so kind and patient and the food quality is very good. I would recommend coming here for lunch instead of dinner
192,"Tried something different wasn't what I thought great servers and host restaurant was clean, but crowded"
193,"extra special chirashi: 5/5The extra special chirashi is amazing and super worth! All the cuts of fish were thick, fresh, and delicious. It even had amaebi and uni! It was a hefty portion but left me feeling thoroughly satisfied. It also comes with miso soup! I would definitely order this everytime I come. My friend got the spicy tuna roll and some other things, apparently the spicy tuna here is pretty spicy because he looked like he was in pain with every bite after the first HAHAHAHA Note: this place is super popular even during weekday lunches. I came on a Friday a bit past noon and had to wait ~20 minutes."
194,"There's a reason why this place ALWAYS has a line. The quality of the fish and price seriously cannot be beat. My go-to for lunch is the Lunch Combo ($12.90) or the Tomi Bento ($14.90), both of which are EXTREMELY reasonably priced at under $15. What I think makes Sushi Tomi stand out is that their sashimi pieces that come in the combos are good quality cuts; this often isn't the case with other places.Parking can be a challenge, as the lot across the street is usually full during mealtimes. I haven't spent more than 5 minutes looking for street parking before, though.Service is fast but not rushed. As long as I'm living in Sunnyvale (which may not be for much longer...), Sushi Tomi will be a go-to for me when the sushi cravings inevitably hit."
195,"I've been here several times now and have never been disappointed. The restaurant itself isn't super big and they have yet to integrate with Yelp waitlist, so you certainly should expect a bit of a wait.Maybe that one punctual friend in your party can put his/her name down first while everyone else shows up 15-20 minutes late. That happened to me a few times, and while I didn't LOVE waiting by myself, at least nobody else had to wait -_-...I am usually a man of habit, so most of the time I just order their sushi rolls. But last time I came, a friend ordered the hamachi kama and it was amazing. Ambrosian even. It was so fatty and so juicy, almost like butter melting in your mouth. I'd definitely recommend you to try that!"
196,Great food and a very warm environment. The wait staff is knowledgeable re the menu and are very friendly.
197,"The quality of the food was pretty good and the salmon roll tasted pretty good. I wanted to try the plum onigiri, and it was not bad, except for the fact that the plum was a bit small, but it was a nice and sweet (a bit unexpected)! I do think they tried to stuff the onigiri with as much rice as possible, so it was quite filling. The sashimi was pretty good, but the tonkatsu was just ok. It was a little busy and we had to put ourselves on the waitlist in the front, but the service was nice and fast. It does feel a bit loud at times, but the lighting and ambience was good. I would recommend this place for people who want good quality sushi!"
198,"Yes this place lives up to the hype!!I've been here a couple times now & each time the wait was around 30min-1h. The restaurant is on the smaller side (for how popular it is) so it gets a little crowded but.. WOW the fish is so good here. The rolls are flavorful, with fresh fish and thoughtful presentation. I tried the omakase set my first time here and was blown away by how high the quality of the fish was for how cheap the set was.Honestly, I'm not the type of person to get regular cravings for sushi, but I find myself craving Sushi Tomi's bombbb nigiri. It's just so good!"
199,"According to my dad:""4.4 stars. You don't come here for the atmosphere, you come here for the fish.""They didn't have a lot if variety or weird specialty rolls, mostly standard stuff. The Hamachi was really fresh and especially delicious. The table service was fast. The door line was also quite long, but moved really quickly."
200,"This place is super overrated. South Bay & Peninsula Yelp has been kinda letting me down with the review inaccuracy lately. /sigh. While not terrible, this place is just exceedingly average (at best). It was kind of annoying to be told i needed to wear a mask for the 3 foot walk from the door to my table (when clearly everyone inside is maskless while eating). I actually watched the hostess send a couple away to get their masks before she'd seat them similarly. It's been over a month since the CDC & state said that fully vaccinated peeps could skip the masks (I got vaxxed 4 months ago...), but the shops in Mt View seem to be hanging on to the old mandates for some reason. Anyway, on to the rest of my dinner...This place also closes early (8pm), like many sushi spots (& other restos) in the area, so fair warning. As a transplanted Cali native who was in NYC for the prior 15 years, I don't think I'll ever get used to places ending dinner service before the sun has even gone done, but whatever. Senior citizen sushi dinner, here we go. I got the ""extra special"" chirashi bowl, which was actually a pretty good assortment of fish, at a decent price ($31), including: Uni (1 small lobe- I THINK it may have been Santa Barbara urchin...pretty good), Ikura (tiny scoop...Nothing to write home about. Typically salty salmon eggs from a jar...I wish I could find the in-house marinated zuke ikura more often), Ama Ebi (ok...but you could feel from the texture- kinda sticky- it wasn't the freshest), kanpachi (pretty good), maguro (oddly cut, but good flavor), Hirame (I think...might have been Tai), Toro (1 pc VERY good. Fatty in the right way, cut properly, very tender & flavorful), Salmon belly (decent, tho cut a bit wrong, so I had to chew thru some leftover skin on my piece), unagi (good, tho cold by the time I got to it. Not sure if it was ever hot), a piece of what looked like MAYBE Saba skin or something, oddly? Dunno. & then a little pocket of seaweed & some marinated mushrooms, with 2 PCs of tamago (sweet omelette) for ""dessert"", heh. They tossed a couple slices of fish cake in there as well, which was a first for me to see in a chirashi bowl, so skipped it. Not a fan. My main complaint with the chirashi was the layout/ presentation. It was just a totally haphazard pile of fish randomly placed on top of other fish, sometimes 3-4 types deep. That's a no-no. If you toss a big slab of salmon toro on top of other fish, guess what? Everything kinda tastes like salmon, from all the oil. The fish should be laid out with SOME thought & order &, ideally, a bit of separation either with space or shiso leaf or something. This thing just looked like a lazy clump of fish slices on sticky rice (no sushi seasoning/ vinegar that I could taste)I also ordered fresh wasabi for the bowl, which was a pleasant surprise to see on the menu (tho they still tossed the wasabi paste stuff IN the chirashi bowl for some reason, with way too little gari/ ginger). They fried the ama ebi head & served it, which is always a nice touch, but they made the cardinal sin of not removing the bitter & gross stomach from the head, prior to frying. So, I bit in & hit that nastiness & it was a wrap for that portion. I was excited to see crispy grilled chicken skin on the menu, tori kawa, but these skewers were also a ""miss"" as the skin was chewy & undercooked, instead of nice & dry & crispy/ salty. Another half bite & done. Towards the end of the meal, they finally brought the Kanpachi Kama I had ordered when I first walked in (see pic). While super cheap at $11, this thing was ALL wrong. First, it was an entire half of a fish head, not the ""collar"" (area between head & gills), which Kama should be. Second, it was served upside down, with the gross fisheye staring at me, instead of crispy meat side up. Lastly, the meat didnt have the nice, crispy/ salty ""shell"" over the meat, that locks in the flavor when you cook it right, keeping the meat beneath nice & fatty/ juicy. It was also served on a leaf of supremely wilted & gross butter lettuce, or something, which only further detracted from the already lousy presentation. No lemon, no salt, no torashi red pepper...so, I asked for all 3. Meat was mediocre, & there wasn't much of it anyway, since the serving was mostly head, so I took a couple bites & then just pushed it away. I politely told my server that this was a fish head, not Kama, & she just responded ""well, that's how we do it here"". Ok, well that's wrong. List it as ""Kanpachi half a fish head"" on the menu then, cuz Kama it ain't...woulda been nice to have it taken off the bill, but since it was only $11, whatever...Overall it was a decent meal, & didn't cost a fortune because of how I ordered it, but everything was a bit ""off"", & overall I left pretty disappointed & underwhelmed. This certainly did not seem like a 4.5 star spot, worthy of thousands of glowing reviews, IMHO. If you know sushi, adjust your expectations waaaay down.u"
201,It appears that they have listened to the reviews. The sit down service has improved since our last visits. Bravo!
202,"If you want excellent sushi and bento boxes with a side of exceptionally bad and rude service, this is the place to be.  Onigiri is a must try. The noodle soups can use more flavor though.Lose your dignity and focus on eating, and don't invite guests :)"
203,Ordered takeout & it was amazing! Got different types of nigiri. Def recommend the toro!
204,"I'm not sure if I just didn't order the right things but I wasn't that pressed. I came on Friday night en route to Monterey. I came late enough that there wasn't a wait. I ordered a tempura appetizer, tobiko nigiri, and a caterpillar roll. The tempura app was okay, the fried vegetables were good but the fried shrimp was soggy and not appetizing. The caterpillar roll was not very good. I think there was too much cucumber for my taste. I don't really like cucumber and the places I go to doesn't put cucumber in it, only avocado. It was a fine meal because I was hungry and I would probably go again if there wasn't a wait... But it seems like during busy times theres a long wait and it just doesn't seem worth it."
205,Sushi here is always great! On the pricier side and there's almost always a long wait for service/takeout but definitely good food! Tomi roll is one of my faves
206,Worst sushi I have ever had. They used what looked and tasted like regular white rice.  Rolls were not held together and the spicy tuna roll was chalky.  The rainbow roll looked like a 1st grader made it and I even have heartburn.  I can't believe the other reviews. Maybe they recently switched owners?  I will for certain never go back.
207,Had lunch here- Ate their sushi/sashimi special.1-presentation     42-taste                    53-parking               5 (it was a ghost town)4-quantity              45-service                46-Wine                   did not drink7-atmosphere      38-value                  4overall                   4I would go back.
208,The sushi was delicious and their customer service was spot on. I also enjoyed the ambiance created within the restaurant.
209,"This is a well known Sushi place, so I had high expectations when coming here. It was quite busy and took some time to get seated. The food was good I tried about 5 different dished and enjoyed most of them. It was a nice dinner and we all enjoyed it."
210,"Oh my goooodness. I didn't realize there was a place that actually flew in their fish from Tsukiji Japan! There is a bit of a wait even on weekdays so bring a jacket on chilly days! There is a free parking lot across the street and abundant street parking around so take your time to find if it's a little busy. Service - very fast, efficient and to the point. Sushi - me and the bf got regular omakase without the appetizers (45$~). I didn't expect much but the fish quality was so good, especially for the uni, mackerel and toro. We ate at a table so we couldn't ask the chef what order to eat the fish but we tried to save the fattier ones for last. It did come with fresh wasabi on the plate, which was great.Tomi hamachi special roll was delicious and I enjoyed tasting the smoke from the broiling. Fried baby octopus - they had a nice crunch but we could tell it had been sitting on the counter for a bit as it was warmish when we started to eat it. Definitely could've used a squeeze of lemon on it!"
211,"The creative side of the menu was spot on. We tried lion king, incredible. The sashimi was great, I had the 4 piece. The bento boxes are huge and decent. Also we tried phili rol, and fatty tuna, both really good. Caterpillar was alright. But not comparable to the rest. I will definitely go back."
212,"I came here on a Sunday evening as part of a group of 5, including one toddler and 3 people who don't really like raw fish. The goal was more to try a nice bottle of sake ($20 corkage fee, FYI) since the taste ranged from myself (""I'll eat anything"") to ""I'll try the sushi if it looks good"" to ""I refuse to even try Japanese food"".First thing, the place was packed. I had called ahead to see what kind of wait we can expect, and the receptionist gave a vague answer of ""it's 15 minutes now but I don't know how long it will be when you get here"". I guess that's a safe way to answer but I'd appreciate a more detailed response, like ""it's 15-30 minutes depending on your party size"". Anyway, this place looked the coolest of the various spots I saw, so we drove over and even got a parking spot right across the street. Anyone other time though and you'd probably have trouble finding a spot since this is basically downtown Mountain View.Skipping the line-waiting, which was about 25 minutes, we were then seated and they helpfully had a high chair quickly set up. So that part was nice.For myself, as soon as I saw the $80 omakase menu with ""special fish"", I was determined to try it. Omakase is generally giving the chef a chance to do whatever he or she wants, so I'm happy to splurge on a special occasion to get some really interesting sushi.For the others, well, the waiter was very patient. My dining companions are picky eaters, they wanted reassurances that they would not be getting raw fish, and basically made the waiter go over everything available and asked if it's cooked. He was mostly patient, although I felt like he was getting a little annoyed after 5 minutes of constant questions. I was certainly getting annoyed.When we mentioned the sake we had brought, the waiter helpfully took it into the back, opened it, discarded the box, and brought us some chilled shot glasses. I would have preferred he bring a chilled container for the bottle as well, but it wasn't available I guess.My companions ordered pretty blah items - gyoza, chicken teriyaki, avocado rolls, basically all the generic stuff. Getting them to actually go to a Japanese restaurant was the big accomplishment, so I'm not going to be too disappointed by their preference. Hopefully over time they get more adventurous.On my end, the meal started with a selection of 3 appetizers. Mixed marinated raw fish, ankimo (monkfish liver), and 3 small fried octopi. Everything was great, although the waiter didn't explain what the dishes were or if there was a recommended order to eat them in.The next part of my meal was the sushi selection, 10 pieces of nigiri, all artfully sauced and displayed. To be fair to the chef, the presentation was good and the fish was at the proper temperature, not served chilled like at a lot of places. Cold masks flavor, so the itamae was clearly confident in his fish as it was between room temperature and slightly warmed. The rice was also good, not quite as loosely packed as I've had in Japan, but far superior to the squished gloppy stuff you get at cheaper places.Unfortunately, the service here was another let down, as I wasn't told what any of the fish were, nor was I told what order to eat them in. Omakase is always done in a specific order, generally going from lightest to strongest tasting, and it would have been better had the waiter told me ""eat clockwise from the top left"" or whatever. I would have liked to know exactly what I was eating as well, not because I'm picky but just because I'm curious. Oh well.My final dish was half of a fish head, gently grilled. The meat was falling apart tender, and still very moist. The skin was fishy in a great way, and I had a lot of fun disassembling the skull and sucking out the eye, brains, and little meat morsels. One of my dining companions looked a little faint watching, but hey, I'm not going to waste food!Our total with tax and tip was about $210, which is not bad for sushi although a little pricey considering the other people mostly had chicken. I think Sushi Tomi will be relegated to special occasions rather than somewhere I try to become a regular due to the cost and the wait.Overall though, I would come back. The service issues aside, our waiter was generally good and everyone agreed the food tasted great. They take credit cards too, which is nice."
213,Hands down the best sushi in the South Bay and peninsula. They have fresh sashimi shipped from Japan and omakase always give you a surprising fresh taste. The only thing is that they do not take reservations and the line is always long. They do not have any smart waiting system (eg a system that you can sign in and wait online while driving there) so make sure you go early.
214,"Pretty solid place to get sushi. From the outside this looks like a small restaurant but when you go in there's actually a good amount of space. I came here with a group of 5 on a Thursday around 6:30PM and the wait was only 15-20 minutes which wasn't too bad. I've heard this place gets packed. For appetizers we got the takoyaki and agedashi tofu. The takoyaki here is some of the best I've had. Would definitely return and get this again. The agedashi tofu tasted a bit over-fried because it wasn't all that soft but still good. For the main course, I got the special chirashi (how it's different from the regular is that this comes with roe and unagi for $5 more). I thought each cut of fish was good but wished the shrimp was an amaebi instead of just being boiled. I think I will stick to just rolls next time. My friends also go the Tomi roll which was their special and thought it was great but they might have overhyped the roll for me because I thought it was going to wow the heck out of me like a kick in the nuts kind of surprise. Regardless, this was still a great sushi place and I would definitely not resist coming back here to try other items from their menu. SERVICE: Great staff, super attentive and not one time did we feel neglected."
215,"We usually go to our sushi place in the South Bay but we were meeting friends from Burlingame, so we decided to go to Sushi Tomi in Mountain View based on the Yelp reviews. We were not impressed. (And by the way, parking was horrible in Mountain View.) There was a line when we got there around 6:20 p.m. I think we waited about 30 minutes. It was a week night. I guess not too bad by Mountain View standard.Service was slow. Took them a while to take our orders.We ordered two sushi dinners, one sashimi dinner and one combination dinner. We did not get any salads with the sushi or sashimi dinners even though the menu said salads were included. We forgot to ask for the salads since we did not notice until it was kind of late.At our regular South Bay restaurant, we never have to ask. The prices at Sushi Tomi are also higher than South Bay. I guess location matters.My friend said the tempura for the combo dinner was subpar. The sushi and sashimi were pretty standard.And the kitchen closes at 8 pm. Beware.Overall, not worth the price and not worth the wait."
216,The best Sushi place that both my daughter and me rate. The rice for the sushi and fish make the difference.
217,"My friend was moving to a new place to start med school so I wanted to treat her to lunch to celebrate. We found this popular Japanese spot in Mountain View, and although they don't currently have indoor or outdoor seating, we were intrigued and wanted to try the food, and I'm so glad we did!Food:- Extra Special Chirashi Sushi--$31We decided to splurge and get the Extra Special Chirashi Sushi because it comes with uni and ikura and we both love uni. It was definitely worth it and the fish was so fresh and yummy. There wasn't too much rice which was perfect to savor the fish--the main star.- Tempura Appetizer--$11.90Tempura is my absolute favorite Japanese dish, so we had to order this one. The appetizer came with two shrimp tempura, and an assortment of veggie tempura that included pumpkin, sweet potato, bell pepper, broccoli, and carrot. The shrimp and veggies were soft and tender, and had just the right amount of batter. The best part was that it came with fried shrimp heads--very flavorful, crunchy on the outside, and soft and juicy on the inside!- Chicken Skin (Tori-Kawa) Skewer--$6.50My friend and I have similar food tastes, and both like chicken skin so we got this skewer. The chicken skin was light and crispy and perfectly broiled with a slightly smoky flavor.- Chicken Gizzard (Sunagimo) Skewer--$6.50It was my first time trying chicken gizzards and I liked it. It had a nice satisfying chew and subtle flavor.Tips:- They currently only have take-out options, and make sure to order by dropping by the store, or by ordering through the phone. The phone line does get busy so be patient and keep calling. Otherwise, drop by in person to the store to place your order.- Order ahead and expect a wait for the food to be prepared because it's a super popular place! My friend and I stopped by 10 min before they opened on a Saturday, and were second in line to order. When we ordered, we were given an estimate of 30-40 min wait for the food to be prepared. We took a walk around Castro Street and the wait was not bad at all.- There are some empty tables and chairs on Castro Street (specifically in front of Icicles) that you can take advantage of if you want to eat right after picking up your food."
218,Not sure where all.the great reviews about the food come from.....review is for sushi some very very fishy! Not the best tasting sushi and definitely not worth the wait. After ordering our food took like 50 min to get it. For the price and quality of sushi go somewhere else
219,"Walk inside and put your name and how many in you party on their list. Choose if you want a table, the Sushi bar or either, and then head back outside and wait to be called. Don't let the line fool you- it moves a lot quicker than you expect. And once you get inside, you will find it was worth the wait, long or short. This place is buzzing! I was given a seat at the bar (my first choice) and was promptly asked for my drink order as I was seated- excellent! I was given a dinner menu and a paper Sushi menu with a pencil, alternatively I could order straight from the Sushi chefs; and a small bowl of Edamame. I ordered a draft beer and a large Saké.For dinner, I ordered several pieces of Nigiri Sushi, as well as 3 rolls. about 15 minutes later I was served a beautifully displayed plate of fresh and tasty Sushi, and enjoyed it immensely.I love sitting at the Sushi bar and watching the chefs do their amazing food-art, but it is also great seeing all the people come and go, and watching the servers organize a veritable symphony of getting people seated in a quick, but orderly fashion.This place is loud and fun, food is excellent, and do NOT be put off by the amount of people outside- it's quicker than you think and worth the wait!"
220,Now that I have a job and better taste in food. I must say this is my fav sushi place ever! Affordable and really good quality sushi! Their salmon is very buttery and melt in your mouth.Service is the front is better than the back area.

222,"I've came here many many times with my mom (because she is a baller, and I'm broke cant afford expensive sushi places lol)The sushi is indeed fresh but bento box are fairly small, last time my salmon teriyaki was incredibly small that i had to order their $17 hamachi sashimi after lol The bill came out to be $70 for us two, DAYMMM i can eat so much other food with that kind of money lol #collegestudentlife"
223,I am a vegetarian but I love the California roles here. They are made so tasty with cucumber and avocado filling inside rolled rice. Lip smacking indeed
224,"Wow, tried this restaurant for the first time tonight and it was spectacular! We were a party of four and ordered a few combos.The omakase with appetizer combo is a great deal! It comes with three different appetizers- they vary from time to time. They are assorted and if you order two for the table you can ask for them to be different.Both the omakase were very fresh- sashimi and sushi. My sushi favorites were scallop, anago, and toro!The sashimi omakase had a large assortment including smoked uni! We also ordered the sushi special- which is $25 but I would definitely upgrade to the omakase sushi! For $45, 10 pieces! The tables nearby had other non sushi dishes which also looked really appetizing- soups, fried squid, don buri! Definitely coming back and trying more of their option.Btw, the wait gets long! We came at 6pm and waited for about 30 minutes. When we left, there was still a wait. So just prepared, it's not incredibly long but just make sure you keep that timing in mind. Everyone has to be present to be seated!"
225,Really good sushi for a reasonable price.  Fresh sushi.  I've only eaten once at the restaurant but the service was good.  I wish they would deliver :(
226,"Lived in the bay all these years and finally tried Sushi Tomi this past weekend (not to be confused with the Tomi buffet in SJ). Sushi Tomi is located right off of Castro on Dana St and there's parking right in front or in the lot right across the street. We knew we had arrived after seeing a small crowd congregating in front.We had a party of 7 and quoted a wait time of 15 mins which wasn't bad at all. Service is fast here! The space is a little cramped or, rather, cozy; one side consists of the sushi bar and the other side has tables for larger groups. Bf and I shared the dinner 2 pc combo (salmon teriyaki and tonkatsu) and the sashimi dinner. These options came with soup, salad, and rice. Boy, were the servings large! We took leftovers home with us. The takoyaki, gyoza, and tempura appetizers were also pretty tasty.A few things that can be improved upon: ordering and the bathroom. The waitress couldn't provide additional details about the menu and it was rather rushed. We wanted the tempura appetizer, not dinner order. First, she said they didn't have it then she said she could do it, but didn't know the price. And let's just say, the bathroom has seen better days."
227,"Came back after not having been in about a year (used to visit rather frequently). Everything went down across the board, from food quality to service. It's upsetting that a place that used to be borderline 5 stars is now barely holding on to 3.5 and I'm being rather generous and rounding up to keep it at 4. I was shocked to find out that the prime time Saturday night wait that used to be an hour was now less than 15 minutes. Sadly, there is a reason for that and it's not because they became more efficient.Doesn't look like the place was maintained much or at all and it looks a bit more run down; not in the modest and humble kind of way - in the we haven't bothered to fix this chipped paint and creaking chairs in years way.The service was worse than I've ever experienced before. Sushi Tomi was always a hit and miss when it came to service but it was especially poor that night and we were mostly ignored and often had to try to wave down other servers, often to no avail. The saving grace was always their food quality. Well, that's not the case anymore, at least for the price point. Sushi Tomi still has no serious competition in the immediate area but their offerings used to be the sweet spot of high quality for relatively reasonable prices, landing them above the local sushi place's quality but still below the cost of some of the higher end sushi places that are indisputably better.Well, I'm sad to say that from the extra special chirashi, to the grilled squid, to the unagi don, their quality has gone down drastically. I've had all these dishes before and they were much, much better. The fish wasn't fresh. The cuts were inconsistent. Rice was subpar. The squid was overcooked and dry. Sure, it still looked good but the quality just wasn't there and the price is still relatively the same. There might be no serious competition in the immediate area but there are plenty of options a short drive away and their quality has gone up, not down. What made Sushi Tomi extra special is no more. Doubt I'll be returning any time soon."
228,"Just a block away from the busy and restaurant filled Castro street, Sushi Tomi is conveniently located and there is a reason why there is always a line (expect to wait an average of 30min).Yes, there really isn't any decent competition in the area that delivers quality sushi but Sushi Tomi is also a good, solid sushi joint. Their fish is fresh, fatty and full of flavor. For the sushi fanatics, do not expect this to compare with the likes of Tokyo Fish Market in Japan or Kusakabe in SF,  but it will neither require you to fly halfway across the world nor drop $200+ for a meal. It's a good middle ground - providing quality, tasty sushi at a reasonable price point. Satisfaction and rating will vary anywhere between 3 and 4.5 depending on what you order. We have found that our favorites that consistently tend to deliver on freshness, taste and overall satisfaction are the Extra Special Sushi/Sashimi/Nigiri Chef's Choice Dinner and the Extra Special Chirashi. Both come with top choices like bluefin tuna and uni along with the expected salmon, tuna, etc. The fish is fresh and fatty and tends to melt in your mouth. The rice, which is often overlooked in lower tier sushi places, is well seasoned, fresh and has the right consistency of fluffiness and stickiness. Service is generally ok but it does tend to be a hit or miss game sometimes. Generally though, the service is acceptable but nothing mind blowing. What you come for here, is the quality of the fish."
229,"I love Sushi Tomi's selection of fresh raw fish & seafood. They have the normal offerings such as salmon, tuna, and yellowtail, and also more ""fancy"" choices such as uni, sweet shrimp, and amberjack. But probably the best part of their fish/seafood selection they also have daily specials from Tsukiji Market in Japan! There's something for everyone here.Every time I come here, I have to be careful with how much I order because the price per head can definitely stack up if you love sashimi and just want a bit of everything. This time I tried their Tsukiji special. They offered a 6 piece nigiri set for $20 and a 6 piece sashimi set for $28. Sadly, I couldn't really remember the fish, but they were all delicious and all had different textures and tastes from one another. My friend got the tenzaru soba with mixed tempura, which honestly is a steal at about $10. We also shared some a la carte nigiri...our favorite is the sweet shrimp as they also fry the shrimp head for you (so good!).This place is always crowded, so make sure you line up early or you're prepared to wait a bit! It's worth it."
230,"This is my favorite reasonably priced sushi place in the area. It has both sushi rolls as well as higher quality (""fancy"") nigiris that are available in upscale restaurants. The fish here is fresh and the rice is solid. When you get here be ready to wait in line for some time (depending on the time it could take 30+ mins). Luckily the owners provide some complimentary hot tea and water outside of the restaurant for people waiting in line.I used to be overwhelmed by sushi choices but now figured out a good order that I usually stick to (2 person order). I'd recommend other people trying it if you are not sure what to get:- I liked to order salmon avocado roll (very good basic roll)- Tomi special roll with hamachi- Hamachi toro nigiri (one of those fancy two piece sushi; worth trying)It's pretty important to eat things in order of ascending strength of flavor if you care about subtle flavors. I thought I didn't care but I tried eating salmon avocado roll after the very rich sushi tomi roll and I couldn't taste much - the roll ended up tasting mediocre because of that. So here's my preferred ordering:- Start with hamachi or whatever plain nigiri. I like to mix some wasabi with a bit of soy sauce, dab chopsticks in the mix and then lightly pat the fish. If you dip the fish in the mix it might end up tasting like soy sauce because it's very concentrated.- Follow with salmon avocado roll. For this one I lightly dip it in the sauce because it's a more basic roll.- Finish with the tomi special roll. I prefer not using the spicy mayo it comes with too much because it's very strong.Overall this is a great sushi spot. The other non-sushi items are decent but their strength definitely lies in sushi."
231,"The waitress was unpleasant; the rolls were limited (only a few) and very VERY plain, simple, and had no descriptions, just names. To our surprise, their special roll was a simple tuna roll. No deserts, no ice cream. Had a feeling they want you in and out right away. Not coming back. The service and food were OK."
232,"We ordered $200 for take-away. We are VERY picky sushi eaters as we make a lot of high-end sushi at home. Our taste buds concluded Sushi Tomi sushi is better than the avg three star rating that Yelp is calculating. So another restaurant that Yelp rates incorrectly.  We liked their Red Dragon and Queen's Scallop special rolls. Rainbow roll was good also.  Also we noticed the Sake Maki rolls were made very exquisitely. People think such a ""common"" roll as a sake makizushi is not worth reviewing but actually one can read a lot into the skill of the sush chef by looking at how much care they put into making makizushi"
233,"Will not order for Togo anymore. Very often for Togo, the sashimi will be missing a few piece. Sometime, soup is missing for the combo order. This time, soup and salad are both missing from our order. Very disappointed after long drive."
234,"Huge fan of their food, not a fan of their lines.Sushi Tomi is located a little bit off the side of Castro Street and there is a ton of parking spaces nearby so no need to fret too much! My mom and I came here for lunch on Sunday around 12pm and the wait time for 2 people was about 40 minutes. We ordered a sashimi lunch and a lunch bento with tempura and katsu. The lunch bento was okay, the tempura was decent and the katsu was kind of dry so I didn't eat too much of it. The sashimi lunch was super good! It had about 11 pieces of really fresh fish, it's a mixture of salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and white tuna.Overall I would definitely come back to Sushi Tomi again. Even though its a tad pricier than other sushi places, I think the quality is definitely worth it. Next time i'm sticking to sushi items only!"
235,Excelente service and the food is great. All the sushi rolls are delicious! They don't take reservations.  We have gone to different sushi places and Sushi Tomi it's our favorite one by far.
236,"Located a few blocks from Castro St. There's street parking in the front and a parking lot across the street. I recommend getting her a few minutes before 6 PM as parking will fill up.We came here on a Wednesday night around 6 PM. There were a lot of people waiting. This place has a lot of room - definitely more than the Saratoga one. For three girls, we ordered tempura and whole squid for appetizers. The tempura was delicious. The whole squid was good, but we wish there was some sauce on it.I ordered the sashimi dinner, which comes with salad and miso soup. It was delicious! The fish was really fresh. Miso soup always hits the spot, especially on a cold day.Overall, the experience was good. I'd definitely go back again. I hear their omakase (around $45) and chirashi are really good too!"
237,"This might be a really weird thing to praise or claim but I'm going to go full pants down and say it, anyways... Sushi Tomi has the BEST spicy tuna rolls I've had in the bay. They taste wonderfully fresh, have a nice creamy texture that melts in your mouth, and actually have some spice to them. I like my wasabi with just a few drops of soy sauce (aka burn up the nostrils spicy) so this combination is dynamite. Two orders and a spicy tuna hand roll with a side of miso soup...easy to please and bursting at the seams...My partner in sushi crime makes up for my lack of variety by indulging in their omakase, which is quite reasonably priced for the amount (10 pieces), freshness and overall quality. Their grilled whole squid is also delicious and worth ordering if you like squid. The way they char the tentacles is amazing and really brings out the rich flavors.Going back to my favorite item, I felt inspired to write a little jingle:(to the beat of Spice Up Your Life)La la la la la la la la la La la la la la la la La la la la la la la la la La la la la la la laWhen you're feelin' sad and low It will take you where you gotta go Come here early, street parking is free All you need is some Sushi TomiWhatchu ordering? Spicy Tuna!Is it really all that good?Hell to the yaah!Whatchu ordering?!Spicy Tuna!Aahhhh~Pass the menu left If you're havin' a good time Shake it to the right Cause it's spicy tuna timeChopsticks to the front Ha ha (uh uh) Go roundPass the menu left If you're havin' a good time Shake it to the right Cause it's spicy tuna timeChopsticks to the front  Ha ha Hai Si Ja Hold tight--end song and review--"
238,"Very fresh fish. I tend to have issues calling in my order as they get really busy so I just order at the restaurant. Their tamago is the best I've had in the bay, soft and fluffy. Their bentos are huge. Chicken teriyaki is nice and flavorful."
239,"Fresh fish flown in from Japan? WHY NOT? The quality is night and day! Pre-Pandemic days, you gotta put your name down & wait for hours to sit down. With Covid, it's take out only. Staff wears masks correctly, hand sanitizer at the door & pick up is a breeze. It's a traditional sushi join, simple yet delicious. The price compared to quality provided is worth it. Expert recommendation: go there to order in person if you can as they list their special fish of the week on the white board (fish flown in from Japan outside their usual items on the menu) and their weekly specials. You can call and ask too but their English isnt excellent and speaking through a mask may be difficult to understand. Place your order, walk down the street to Maison Alyzee to pick up to die for Parisian desserts. Go home and treat yourself to an amazing date night. You're welcome.But seriously, pls support this place. Would really be devastated if they dont make it through 2021."
240,The food here is always amazing and the wait was super reasonable. I hadn't been back here since before COVID but now I will definitely come back more. They never miss with the food and it's nice to know the quality hasn't changed. Staff are very nice and attentive. 100% recommend!!
241,"I was in the area on a Saturday and was looking for a sushi place. I got here right when it opened and all the seats were just about filled. Get here early or else you will be waiting.Because of all the reviews and amount of people waiting, I had high expectations. When I got my chirashi bowl I wasn't that impressed. It was on the smaller portion side and there wasn't anything special about the fish. I thought it was ok overall but nothing I would wait in line for. I would be open to trying other items on the menu if I was in the area next time, but wouldn't go out of my way to come back."
242,"Got here 20 minutes before the restaurant opened. There was already a line when we got there. I'm not sure exactly what it's like when the restaurant opens, because we went on Valentine's Day. Luckily, we got in for the first seating. Great customer service. We ended up ordering 10-piece omakase for $50. Everything was very fresh and did not taste fishy. We were expecting the omakase to be served to us one by one, but instead we got all 10 pieces at once. That is the only reason why I have a four star rather a five star. It would've been nice to have been served one piece at a time. However, for time sake and being that there was a huge wait, it made sense to serve us with all 10 pieces at once. I would definitely come back for special occasions! Highly recommend!"
243,Still amazing after all these years! They've had some staffing changes which could use a bit more training and some menu items that I've loved has been taken off but the sashimi is still super fresh and the bento boxes are still delicious!
244,"This place is still one of my favorite sushi places on the Peninsula. It's turned into one of our near weekly haunts. (Ouchie on the wallet though!) We've refined our orders down so that it's our standard each time we go.Combination: Salmon sashimi and saba shioyaki. Salmon is still buttery smooth, delicious and fresh. The saba is moist and perfectly smoky from the grill.Amaebi Nigiri. Freshest amaebi I've ever tasted. They also have some of the best fried amaebi heads. I'm all about the fried heads.Uni Nigiri. *Drool* this can be hit or miss. Most of the time hit. I had it once where it was slightly iodine-strong on the flavor.Gyutan skewers. Meaty and delicious. Love it with a splash of lemon!Yakionigiri. Yum yum. It's like a crunchy rice ball. But better. Their pickles are amazing.In addition to that, we'd order a plethora or rotating sashimi nigiri items from toro, hamachi, to snapper. Once in a blue moon I'll order the tako ibo. Grilled octopus suckers, paired with grated ginger and a squeeze of lemon. Oishi!!!"
245,"You know that scene in Finding Nemo where Bruce goes ""Fish are friends... not food?"" Well I totally disagree. The fresher the fish, the happier I am. The better the fish, the more I dance with glee!In the past I've ranted and harped on non-Japanese owned wanna-be Japanese Restaurants. Seriously, just cause the restaurant has a Japanese sounding name and some random characters doesn't make it Japanese. A clue into this would be the presence of stir fry like items on the menu or bulgogi. Stay away from Chinese and Korean owned places since all they care about is the bottom line and making money off of you. Stick with places like this. Where the sushi chef cares about his bottom line, but he takes great joy in slicing up fish. A place where he'd rather toss out a bad batch of fish than chop it up, spice it up and serve it, or put it in some fancy roll and top it with some fancy sauce to mask it. (Yes, Sushi House, Chocolate Sushi, Blue Water, I'm talking about you guys!)Sushi Tomi... tucked away like a gem to be discovered. The sashimi was fresh. Unadulterated. Pure. Clean, simple, non frou-frou to showcase the quality of the fish.Nigiri:Sake - sliced thick with a good marbling. We ordered the normal but this is one of the rare places in the Bay Area where they offer the Toro version of salmon. It was buttery sweet. It was soft, it was rich. It was heaven in orange and white stripes.  I love how well it pairs with soy sauce... the initial saltiness from the soy sauce changes to the sweetness from the fish.Kanpachi - we love kanpachi and we try to order it every chance we get. The texture was firm, with a slight bite to it... like a really good al dente fish. Not the least bit fishy, rich, but now sweet.Amaebi - I'm personally not a huge fan of this as it tends to have post sticky feel in my mouth. Shrimp sashimi is hard to prepare as you need to have extremely fresh shrimp. Definitely doesn't disappoint. Slight traces of the sea at first bite, then the fresh sweetness comes out. The fried shelled heads were served on the side with a wedge of lemon. Being a texture-eater, it was delicious. Crunchy, slightly briney and perfect with a touch of lemon.Sashimi:Maguro - I normally hate eating maguro. If it isn't super fresh, I can taste undertones of a slightly metallic-iron taste. Also, it goes bad fast so lots of places hide it in rolls with sauces or turning it into spicy tuna. The freshest maguro I've had so far was in Seattle. Ever since then, I've been hesitant on eating it. I tried it here, first with a hesitant nibble then quickly finished off my piece. It came as close to the maguro I had in the Pacific Northwest. Firm to the bite, not the least bit fishy. It didn't taste processed nor did it have the faux bright red color that many a restaurant has tried to serve to me. (A lot of places will try to revitalize old maguro by blasting it with carbon monoxide... it causes the fish to go from a dull brownish red to a bright red.) It was perfectly red, like a healthy fresh slab of maguro should look like. I never crave tuna like I crave salmon, but if I'm ever here again and it's placed in front of me, I wouldn't turn my nose.Hamachi - Firm, al dente with a good texture. Not fishy at all, but not as sweet as salmon or tuna. It had a nice bite to it and it had sweet aftertones on my palatte. Paired well with the tang from the ginger and the briney soy sauce. Salmon - please see above. *Drool.*Non Sashimi/Nigiri items:Nabeyaki Udon - my parents' favorite cold and rainy night dish. The broth here was done well. They definitely didn't skimp on anything. The kombu and the fish shavings produced a nice rich broth with plenty of umami. The broth was clean tasting yet rich. Chicken was well done and that was the only thing lending to a tad bit of oil floating on the soup. Conbined with a perfectly poached egg and a few slices of shiitake lending an earthiness, it was a well composed dish. The noodles were the chewy kind - cooked to the right al dente bite!Tempura Udon - I love getting tempura udon since I'm not such a huge fan of poached chicken or egg. The broth was missing the earthy shiitake component of the nabeyaki but witout it, this place cooks up a solid dashi broth. The tempura for both noodle dishes were served on the side, you get two shrimp for the tempura version compared to one for nabeyaki.Tempura - the tempura deserves a blurb on its on. It was lightly battered, perfect crunchy batter to ingredient ratio. My favorite was the shrimp and eggplant. On second visit my eggplant was replaced with Kubota pumpkin. Definitly liked eggplant better. I had requested a side of tempura dipping sauce and it was served warm. I wasn't a fan of it as much since it had ginger undertones. Saba shioyaki - briney, slightly smoky, definitely having a richer taste compared to everything else. It was served with a side of grated daikon to help cut the grease. Lunch on weekends = 15% off the sashimi menu!"
246,"We did have to wait outside for about 15 minutes but we didn't have a reservation and it was worth the wait! Bustling, warm atmosphere from the get go. Miso soup was delicious to start. Ordered sashimi and sushi plates and both exceeded expectations. Very reasonable prices and speedy, friendly service. We will come back!"
247,"I've been here twice, solid joint to get some quality nigiri, I decided to nab an omakase meal for its variety. The best piece was definitely the otoro fatty tuna.. my god.. it started melting with the faintest touch of my tongue as the fish's flavor oozed out. I'd say one of their must have's is their house roll with spicy tuna, it was one of the best rolls I've ever had. I have no damn idea whether I came on a good day because the sushi rice was so moist that the roll felt loosely rolled that collapsed perfectly to the bite, yet perfectly held together that it didn't fall apart with the touch of the chopsticks... it was fantastic. This has got to be my fav sushi spot rn, it can get pricy but it is reasonably priced."
248,If you are hungry go and eat but be prepared for crowded noisy no atmosphere place... The waitress chased me outside when she didn't receive the tip she deserved..... not coo! Order take out  if you want to eat in peace and not be disrespectfully treated.
249,"Sushi tomi is a great spot to get fresh sushi. In particular, we love the ""Tomi Special"" with salmon! There's a bunch of flavor and quality fish."
250,"Guys, please work on your pickup line management. Waiting 45 mins for food to be ready, ok. Wait another 45 mins in pickup line, unnecessary. Have someone check the line for names with orders ready."
251,"My nephew and I were around the area and tried this place out (he loves sushi and has been to Japan) The wait time was ok, food was a little pricey than usual for the quality. The sushi was not fresh and the curry was already room temperature.Definitely a one try place"
252,"In a word: outstanding.  Fresh, expertly prepared, beautifully presented, choices well beyond the usual, adept service, clean comfortable and modern space.  What makes it outstanding- this was a truly memorable meal."
253,"Came here with kids and husband around 5:15 and it was already packed. So wrote on the waitlist and told the kids + husband to hurry back to the car since it was cold. We parked down the street, 3 car spaces away from the entrance. I was waiting for the table alone right outside. After about 45 minutes, an older Asian lady came out and called our name. The lady told me that ""i need to see the faces"". I told her okay I'm going to get my kids from the car right now and it will take 1 minute. I rushed back to the car to unload the kids, and it literally only took one minute since the car was so close and when I got there, guess what, she gave my table to someone else! She was not in sight anymore and there was another younger waitress there. I told her that my table was ready and I'm here with my husband and kids. She then told me rudely ""we don't have a table"". I was furious and I explained to her what happened. It was obvious that she didn't give a hoot about anything and proceeded to tell me there's no table again. We stormed out of the restaurant and left. My husband was not going to let this slide and he went back in to confront the older Asian lady. She came out to apologize and she told me that people often lie to her about having everyone in their party together???? I told her again that I was just trying to get my kids out of the car and the car was right there, why would I lie about it?? She could have waited for one minute before giving my table away which I been waiting for 45 minutes!! I been a patron of Sushi Tomi for the past 10 years. Not only this Sushi Tomi but also the one  in SJ because it's right by my office. I know I'm not any VIP customer but please show some respect for your paying customers. The people who work there are too rude for my taste and they obviously don't give a s^*t if you're happy or not. We will never go back to this place again and won't ever recommend this place to anyone. So disappointed!"
254,"It's too bad no other sushi bar can touch this place; we'd have more dispersion and less waiting times if Sushi Tomi wasn't so damn good!We came here after seeing the Lion King in hopes of being ironic and ordering a Lion King roll.  Guess what? They don't cook any of their fish, so they didn't have one!  We instead asked the sushi chef to pick some nigiri for us; it was so fresh that I nearly developed gills.I can't wait until I return- this is definitely the place I will continue to come when other raw fish connoisseurs need to be impressed."
255,"We needed a place for a late night dinner and Japanese food was on everyone's mind.  So fortunate to have found this place.  The prices seemed high initially, but the portions were perfect for our big appetites.  The only disappointment was my rainbow roll, which looked like the scrap ends of the fish were used.  We were the last seating of the night, but not an excuse to use scraps.  It wasn't too fresh either, but all the other dishes ordered were really good."
256,"One of the few sushi places owned by Japanese people in the South Bay. The sushi here is always fresh and there's always a line out the door so be prepared to wait. Their service isn't anything amazing but their fish alone is well worth the visit. If there wasn't a line all the time, I'd definitely come here more often. Definitely five stars for their fish!"
257,"I met up with my old colleagues here for dinner. Service was very attentative, didn't wait very long,  but do arrive early as it gets super pack. Vacated mostly by tech workers in the area. It is the  meeting grounds for start-up talks, first dates to local Japanese patrons living nearby.I say most on their menu were delicious.  Loved their grilled Hamachi and sashimi platter. Place is small but still offers a unique hole in the wall experience. Best time to arrive is around 5pm when they open for dinner.Cheers and arigato."
258,"Good sushi and nice staff, however, expect to wait a while outside. The hostess just seated four walk-up parties ahead of us. The waitlist doesn't seems to be merely a suggestion."
259,"Went here on a Monday evening and there were tons of people already waiting in line! The wait was about 30 minutes so my friend and I just walked down Castro and enjoyed the refreshing night to pass time. Soon enough, we were seated and we both ordered the extra special chirashi bowl. While on the pricier side of things ($30), it is well worth it. Each cut was insanely thick and tasted like heaven in my mouth. My mouth is watering just thinking about it again. It also comes with miso soup which is a classic this place did no wrong with. The bowl is plenty filling and has got to be the best thing I've eaten in a long while. We weren't checked on too often, so it would've been nice to have our waters filled a little quicker. The chirashi bowl is just so good that I have to give this place 5 stars still. I recommend this place to anyone looking to eat some mouth watering sushi!!!"
260,"It looked pretty promising given the busyness of the establishment and the lineups so I thought I would be in for a legit sushi experience.Sadly the fish quality and presentation was mediocre at best. Our food was served on plastic plates which was odd for me. The taste of the fish and the rice was average, nothing spectacular about it. I tried the O toro and it didn't look or taste like an O toro piece and was more like a Chu toro at best.Scallop sushi wasn't as sweet as other places I have had. Looks like they used American Scallop instead of the popular Hokkaido Scallops.The interior was very outdated and did not feel like a sushi bar or establishment.Probably won't be a returning customer as I'm pretty sure there's much better options for legit sushi in this city."
261,"I couldn't say no more. I wanted leave another 5 stars review. Absolutely amazing. The price is just awesome and food quality is dying for! Today I just got another chill by rice. It was dancing in my mouth. I got there at 11:25 and after 25mins since they open, the restaurant packed with people. There were people waiting already! Probably about 7 parties. Crazy crazy."
262,"Totally bomb! I mean everybody know it already.. this place is wonderful. I came here for lunch wondering why people lined up so much all the time.I couldn't even try this place. It was that busy! And there is no waiting area so it is painful to wait on site to get in. But, it is worth it. A great value of lunch deal. I ordered Nigiri Lunch plate. It was fabulous. Rice, The rice!!!!!!! It is like a Japanese cartoon. Rice dance in your mouth as individuals. No more rice cake! Best rice ever. Probably Yamada Nishiki from japan??? Unfortunately I can tell, maybe not, they might use a bit different fish for lunch plates. I received salmon nigiri with skin on. Which is not desirable.  So I asked them to get another one and they did. That was nice. The service can be a little tricky. They are really busy for lunch. You wouldn't get a many chance to interact with your server. You are just quick lunch money to disappear. But the food pay off everything. And it comes out quickly. I will be back for lunch for sure . Dinner? Maybe I am not sure yet. Line is way too long."
263,They are great! It is an unforgettable experience when the food is cooked in front of you. I'm a huge sushi lover and they are some of the best at Sushi Tomi!) Nice presentation. Huge portions. I enjoyed the meal overall and would definitely be back. THANKS!
264,"I've come here a few times and there's always been a mini wait, but short enough for us to endure without much complaining. Most recently I ordered the regular chirashi bowl and thought the fish tasted pretty fresh and got an abundant amount of food. The bento boxes looked pretty appetizing and I think I might get one next time if I'm there for lunch. I've also gotten a few of their rolls before and they've been pretty decent.The service can be a bit slow and we didn't get attention as quickly as we wanted to for water and the check, our waitress was friendly and warmly responded. Not a totally mind-blowing experience but definitely will recommend if you are in the area!"
265,"Sushi Tomi always commands a wait--ours was just over 40 minutes for dinner on a Friday night. The service here was amazingly friendly and helpful, and everything was delicious, though I'm not sure that it was so special that it was worth a long wait.We started with the Tomi Special roll with avocado, salmon, scallop, and torched hamachi. The rainbow roll (with imitation crab and avocado on the inside) was just as delicious, topped with a colorful assortment of shrimp, salmon, tuna, and more! The entrees came with a side of soup and salad--we had the unagi don, which came with a generous portion of grilled eel in the signature sauce, as well as the grilled mackerel (saba). Both were delicious entrees, and though the dishes here tended to be on the pricey side, the quality of everything was amazing!"
266,"Sushi Tomi is located off the main strip in downtown Mountain View, and it was quite crowded when I arrived for lunch on a rainy Saturday. Despite having to put our name on a list, though, we were seated within minutes, and our kind server was very attentive and brought us everything we needed.We started off with the special Tomi Special maki roll with salmon--the top of the salmon was torched, and it even looked like the salmon on the inside was half cooked, which made for an interesting combination. The roll also came with avocado, spicy mayo on the side, and sliced red onions on top; the roll wasn't bad, but was somehow not particularly flavorful and could have used something more either as a topping or as a filling.The other item we shared was a lunch special consisting of a poke salad and kama (grilled fish collar). The poke salad was interesting--it had the perfect amount of spice, and the vegetables gave it a nice crunch, but the quality of the fish (looked like salmon and tuna) was a little bit lacking--definitely not the cream of the crop. The ""kama,"" it turned out, consisted of two grilled fish heads, which looked a little bit intimidating but had excellent flavor. However, this ""special"" was definitely not worth $16, as it seemed they had just put it on the menu to get rid of leftover fish parts.Overall, while the service was extremely good and the food decent, this meal wasn't really worth the price, especially given the small portions of the items we ordered. If I come back again, I'd probably go for other things on the menu or splurge on nicer quality fish."
267,"What can I say that hasn't been said before?Asami is the main hostess here at Sushi Tomi and she's been a staple and important part of this amazing place since I've been coming here.She is great with service as well - she's helped to seat but also to serve when times are very busy. I thought that I'd give a huge shout out to her since she's always so kind to me when I go.This is my go to place in Mountain View, and basically in the South Bay for the best sushi place.They are one of the freshest and most authentic places I've ever gone to. They even offer fish imported from Japan. Only the freshest cuts. And if you like Uni.. oh boy you'll love how complex and sweet and salty uni is here.My go to is the Chirashi. Any of them really. They range from 20 - 30 depending on your appetite for adventure. I always get the special one because the size and the offerings (they include uni) are perfect. I also enjoy the beef tongue. It may seem like a weird choice but it's delicious and tender cuts are perfectly broiled and seasoned. Perfecto.The food:Chirashi - $25, 10/10. Perfect serving size and beautiful presentation. The cuts of fish are delicious and fresh and are plentiful. MUST GETBeef tongue - ?, 10/10. It's soooo good. Tender and flavorful. Bqqd and delicious! I love it all. You can't go wrong with ordering anything. If you ever get the chance, grab a seat at the sushi bar and do Omakase. It's wonderful.Also - go early. Every time. You'll wait a minimum of 30 minutes."
268,"Well, I am thoroughly shocked that I did not discover Sushi Tomi sooner. For the price point and the fish quality, this is really a gem. My husband and I came here on a Monday evening, and there were maybe 5 or 6 groups ahead of us in line. We put our names down and waited about 20 min to be seated (after the first wave of dinner guests finished). We ordered the tuna cut roll, the hamachi kama, and two orders of the special chirashi. I'll talk about these separately. The tuna cut roll: not bad, but didn't blow my mind. Hamachi kama: I'm salivating just thinking back on this. This hamachi kama might very well be one of the best hamachi kama dishes I've ever had. It tasted so fresh that there was no fishiness, just pure flavor. While generally I like to add some lemon or sauce to my hamachi kama, this fish was so flavorful that my husband and I devoured it plain, using our chopsticks to pick off the tiny flaky bits left over. 10/10 would get again. We were so full but were determined to finish off the hamachi kama.Special chirashi bowl: Honestly, really great for the price. You get a lot of different fish, plus ama ebi and fatty tuna! (You can see what fish is included in my attached photo).  You really only need the chirashi to be satisfied, but we were just too excited to find Sushi Tomi and ended up ordering too much. I'm already looking forward to coming back!"
269,"So the first time I visited Sushi Tomi, I was probably a sushi noob, not to say I'm an expert now. But anyway, the first time around I loved everything they made. But this time around, since I've been eating around town a lot, I can easily tell Sushi Tomi is a 3-star. In a lot of ways the Special Tomi roll summarizes what Sushi Tomi is - a mediocre sushi spot with a mediocre menu selection; just like the uninspiring roll. The unagi BBQ roll was rather good; but then again I've never had bad unagi yet. The cold soba was refreshing. The dipping sauce was not overpowering but it did impart a wonderful flavor onto the soba. The rainbow roll was also very mediocre.In summary, the lines outside Sushi Tomi are... misleading."
270,"The waiter graciously moved us to a better table when we asked. That service alone deserves 5 stars. But the food was also very good. The Chicken Don tasted the way it was supposed to (I was told). The sushi rolls while they were nice, their texture could've been better. Oooh. Also got some salmon roe rice. Not a big fan but apparently that's how it was supposed to taste. Go here fellas. Actually don't, I'd like lesser competition for the better seats."
271,"EXCELLENT, non-expensive sushi in the Palo Alto area. I can't say enough about this place other than it compares to some of the best (and most expensive) sushi places I've dined at before. Super fresh seafood and delicious cooked dishes. We had the chicken teriyaki with white rice, as well as the rainbow roll -- which I should note has real snow crab and not imitation. Saki to pair was an excellent choice. Only thing to be aware of is there tends to be a small wait (no reservations) for Sushi Tomi. It goes quick, and trust me, it's worth the wait.I will definitely continuing coming back here!"
272,"Everyone who's been here knows that the sushi is good... but if you haven't tried the Nabeyaki Udon yet, you need to.It comes with blanched spinach, a poached egg, a generous amount of chicken, and shrimp & vegetable tempura. The broth is deeply flavorful and udon is silky and has just the right amount of chew. The chicken is always tender. I've ordered the udon sometimes with negihama maki over 20 times now.This doesn't happen too often, but some days the broth will have some scum on top and the chicken will still have skin on it... I normally don't have problems with chicken skin, but I think because the donabe (pot) stays so hot, it melts the chicken skin into mush. It hasn't happened recently and am hoping the problem has been nipped for good."
273,"There is a wait to go in. The sushi is solid, but not that good. I feel like there is no reason I can think of to go to this place over a large majority of other sushi places. I got the 10 piece nigiri plate. It tasted good. The portion for each nigiri I thought was small. Not much fish or rice for each piece. The price is a bit too expensive. Overall this place is just mediocre. I mean sushi almost always tastes good as long as it's fresh which it is here so I don't have anything bad to say it's just like WHY? Why come here? It's the most average sushi ever."
274,"Solid Japanese place for bentos and sushi in downtown MV. Located right across from a public parking lot, parking is easy - there's also street parking nearby. Their menu is pretty simple, though they have a separate menu for sushi and beers. Prices are fair, though some items are a bit pricier than other Japanese places, but overall, solid Japanese place for the price. They are packed on the weekends!Lots of people ordered the sashimi lunches, and they also had a mini chirashi lunch special for $12.90 (varies daily), which is what I ordered. The sashimi was pretty decent in the chirashi, and the portion size was pretty big given that it was the ""mini"" version. We also tried their oyako-don, which was delicious and super worth the portion size. Nabeyaki udon was pretty solid as well, and the tempura came on a separate plate, so your choice whether or not to dunk it :) And we also got their typical bento sets, where you can pick 2 entrees and it comes with soup and salad. Salmon teriyaki was solid and the 3 pieces of sashimi that we chose was also good. All in all, solid Japanese restaurant (they have another location in SJ), but be prepared for a wait. They look small from the outside, but they can actually accommodate quite a bit of people inside. There's also a few seats at the sushi bar. The green tea that they serve was also really nice! Didn't try their sushi this time around, but maybe I'll give it a try on my next visit :P"
275,Our favorite place to go for sushi. Fresh sashimi and dinner combo are so good. I always order spider roll and caterpillar roll at every Japanese restaurant and I think their spider roll is good but not the best.
276,"I've gotten away with not reviewing Sushi Tomi for as many years, since I've always secretly hoped it'd be less busy so I could eat there without waiting as long. I've sort of accepted that the high quality and the consistency of this restaurant at a prime location basically means I will not get a seat without waiting. I understand that.I've enjoyed their grilled mackerel, their chazuke, and sushi over the years. If you're in Mountain View and don't mind waiting, I definitely recommend Sushi Tomi as a solid choice."
277,"We have heard a lot of good things about this place so we decided to try it out. It was Friday during dinner time so the line was long - we waited about an hr or so. There are a ton of options to choose from so take your time looking through the menu and deciding what you want to try. We ended up ordering:-combination dinner (chicken teriyaki + tenpura & comes with miso soup and salad): very solid portions for a good price. The teriyaki was average (not bad but not special) and the tempura was a bit oily and the tempura breading was very thick and dense, when it should have been more light and airy. -tomi special roll (spicy tuna): This was our favorite pick out of everything we got. Very flavorful and fresh. We would get again, but was not enough to have us want to come back. -extra special nigiri sushi: the nigiri was just average. Fish was decently fresh but nothing special. Unfortunately, the rolls it came with were the star and not the nigiri. Overall, we were not impressed in anyway. and will continue to look for our go to sushi spot in the Bay."
278,"I arrived here around 11:45am on a Saturday expecting a wait since this is a really popular restaurant. However, we were able to get seated right away to my surprise, but the restaurant was almost fully occupied by the time that I arrived. If you're able to go right when they open you can probably avoid a wait.  It was great that they had a bunch of different options for lunch specials. My friends who were with me ended up ordering the lunch combo where you get to pick two entrees which was a great value. I ended up ordering the sashimi lunch which came with tuna, salmon, yellow tail, and white tuna. I thought the food was good and would definitely want to come back to try their entrees that are not sashimi. The service was also good. All the waitresses were pretty nice. They were also attentive as they came by to refill our teas. Overall I had a good experience at Sushi Tomi and would like to come back to try their other items such as the saba shioyaki and the tonkatsu."
279,Currently they are only doing takeout but the fish is very fresh. Because of the small kitchen the wait can be lengthy...call your order ahead!
280,"Best sushi in the area for the price! I've been coming to Sushi Tomi with my boyfriend once a week for the past month and a half and it's never failed to satisfy my sushi craving. I think the main differentiator between Sushi Tomi and other sushi places is that their rice is well-seasoned, and their fish is always very fresh. The lines can be very long (30+ minutes) especially on weekends, but the sushi is so good that I don't mind waiting for it. The restaurant is located right off of Castro street, so while we wait we usually walk around to pass time.My favorites are the:- salmon avocado roll- Tomi special roll with hamachi (I found the spicy mayo sauce on this dish to be pretty tiring, but luckily it's on the side)- hamachi toro nigiriThe only roll I've tried from them that I didn't like was the shrimp tempura roll. The rice-to-meat ratio was too high for me, and the lettuce in the roll didn't particularly add much. I've also tried their other dishes like donburi, but I didn't enjoy them quite as much as the sushi. Overall:- the wait can be long on weekends (tip: try to go near closing for a shorter wait)- great place for sushi, but maybe not worth the wait for non-sushi dishes"
281,"Ordered several dishes including nabe udon. Udon smelled and tasted like melted plastic ,Seriously! Tempura was served without dipping sauce, salad with karage was served without dressing. Server was rude and this place is super noisy. I don't understand why they have so many customers. Do they really know about Japanese food??"
282,"Update during SIP: the place is still working, but they only take orders walk in. Wish they would pick up the phone for orders But the quality of food is the same"
283,"Doesn't look like much but we were intrigued by giant line outside. Interior is very cozy and the staff friendly, but pricey and busyWould recommend chirashi bowl and teriyaki beef. Compared to other sushi places in the Bay, this one seems more authentic. Beware of wait times - can be 30+ minutes if you come after 6 pm."
284,"During non-COVID times it's been super busy usually with lines out the door. When I first ate here, I thought it was quite delicious, with generous portion sizes for sushi and good quality bentos. I don't know if some other sushi restaurants have ruined me or I was just blind before, but I think the quality is not there compared to what I would classify as the A-class of sushi restaurants. Obviously if we're looking at LA, places like Shunji, Hamasaku, or Shiki definitely are solid A-class sushi places with their omakase offerings. I know this ain't a place specifically specializing in omakase (though I'm sure they do offer at their sushi bar), but even in LA Sushi Gen literally destroys this place. In the Bay Area, Hinata, ICHI Sushi definitely destroy this place as well, but I would say I actually liked the sushi at Sushi House over Sushi Tomi. It just seems like there's something off about the quality of food I've been getting at Sushi Tomi that because I've had comparable places in CA like Sushi House or Sushi Gen, it may not necessarily be that my palate has been ruined. Sushi Gen is definitely A-class sushi in a B-class environment while Sushi House is definitely B-class for both.So for the fanatics out there, I'd say maybe shop around. I've seen some other reviews that sort of confirm that I'm not entirely wrong, though of course, this can't be enough proof due to confirmation bias. For the best bentos if you're willing to forgo the tempura batter and instead accept panko (breadcrumb) shrimp, I highly recommend Gombei in Downtown San Jose. The Menlo Park location is not as good as San Jose and doesn't have specials on their menu (which are fantastic). You'll find a much better chicken teriyaki and fantastic beef teriyaki (if they make sure to clean the grills before each batch).I think I'd be willing to go see if the Tomi Sushi in Cupertino (same owners I think as Sushi Tomi) is still as good as I remember from 8 years ago) before making my final verdict, but I won't be coming to Sushi Tomi again when it's too much of a hit or miss."
285,"First time here, and I'll definitely be back when I'm in town. I just want to start of by saying that I have had one of the best customer service experiences here. I walked by this restaurant hesitating to walk in because they were 30 minutes from closing lunch hours to prep for dinner. I saw the lady at the front, whom takes the orders step out of the restaurant and I quickly walked back to her and asked if they are still taking orders. She replied ""yes, I'm waiting for you."" We both smiled. I really needed my sake sashimi fix, so I'm glad she was willing to take my order. I was seated at the sushi bar.Food: I want to start off by saying, the hot tea is FREE here. I love tea! I ordered unagi nigiri, salmon avocado roll and sake sashimi of course! The ungai was super delicious and I love how the eel is actually a big piece! I literally could barely fit it all in one bite. The sauce was delicious as well. It was not too sweet. I kind of wish I ordered more haha. Then onto the sake sashimi. Oh my! The pieces are thick and fresh, just how I like my man, I mean my sashimi LOL. It had a great texture and you don't taste a whole lot of fishiness even though you are eating fish. That's sushi-grade sashimi for ya! Now, the salmon avocado roll was delicious too, but as I was eating a couple pieces of the roll, I found a fish bone. The rolls were also poorly wrapped. It was quite loose and all the filling was semi falling apart. However, I let my  waitress Carrie know about the issue and immediately she addressed the concern to the chef. As a result, they deducted the salmon avocado roll from my tab. I felt bad, but she was also sorry that had happen. So, I really appreciate their customer service here! I also revived miso soup and ice cream on the house, which is ah-may-zing! She also checked up on me and asked if I needed anymore hot tea. She's a total sweetheart! Plus, everything here is reasonably priced!Note: I want to add that I have been to other sushi restaurants before and have found fish scales and sharp bones in my sushi, but the waiters haven't done anything about it. This is why this restaurant deserves 5 stars. :)"
286,Fresh sushi and tasty appetizers!!!  They had this crispy crunchy clam nigiri that was amazing!My only gripe would be about all the fruit flies buzzing around during our meal.  If they fixed that this would be the only sushi place I would go to.
287,"Soooooooo excited that I found this place. Not near my house but worth the drive. I've never had such good tasting California Rolls, a must order with every meal. The daily special was so diverse, and unique. It was a great deal too, and I'm so satisfied!! Such great freshly made sushi. The restaurant gives you a ton of food too!!"
288,"Stopped here for dinner over President's day weekend. They don't take reservations and the line was out the door. It's a small hole in the wall kinda place. But the food was solid and pretty big portions for the size. They offer all of the basics, but not much more so don't expect a lot of fancy or creative roll options.I got the combo dinner with sashimi and beer teriyaki which also comes with soup, salad, and rice. The fish was super fresh. I would go back although I would try other options in the area first since it didn't knock me off my feet."
289,Food: The food was pretty good. I got a bbq eel roll and lunch combo w/ teriyaki chicken and tempura. The tempura was delicious. The chicken teriyaki was also pretty good. The bbq eel roll was disappointing though. The roll itself was super loose and fell apart a bit before it got to the table. The sushi was also fairly bland and disappointing.Staff: The staff was quick and helpfulAmbience: the restaurant was packed but the tables weren't too crowded. Bento box trays were also pretty cool looking and huge.
290,"There is a reason Sushi Tomi always has a line, and the other sushi places on Castro don't. They do not disappoint! Sushi Tomi has fresh, good quality fish, and tons of options to choose from. They are small, so it is a little cramped, especially if you have a large group, but they do their best to accommodate. Service is polite and attentive, and they plated our large order together beautifully. Teriyaki portion was good, and sashimi is cut generously. You can't go wrong!Pro tip: make sure to grab some candy on your way out, it's tasty Japanese gummies and milk candy!"
291,"Wonderful spot for great sushi! Went on a Friday night with friends based on a recommendation. It's a small very understated place, but the constant wait speaks for itself and it lives up to its reputation. Make sure to go right after work to beat the insane line. We got there around 5:30 or 6, and still had to wait about 20 minutes. By the time we left the line was out the door. You can't go wrong with any selection on the menu!"
292,"I went Sushi Tomi with my customers. It's a small place and we waited for 20 min for a table. We ordered Omakase sushi dinner course (chief's special) including appraisers, $45 per person. I loved it. All ingratiates are fresh and so tasty!Ambiance:  a popular sushi place in the townService: okFood: greatPrice: reasonable for the food"
293,"Came here for dinner with friend. Tried this place for the first time after knowing about it for the past 13 years, lol. It's because every time I come here, the wait time is so long. And that's because it's very good food. However I never have time to wait. This time my friend got a table early so I did not have to wait. I was coming from East San Jose. We ordered a variety of sashimi. Very fresh and super delicious. Staff are super friendly and courteous with great hospitality. Very attentive to refilling our drinks and asking if everything is ok every so often.  Good thing that stands out is they did not give us the check until we asked for it. My friend and I both parked on Castro Street (parallel parking spaces) where the spaces are quite big. Inside, there are signs posted saying something like ""Please hide valuables in car"". That's because people's cars been broken into. Not enough street lights. We just park on Castro since we like walking after dinner. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner at Sushi Tomi very much and we'll be back soon. It's better than most sushi places. And customer service is way better than most too. So I recommend this place. Check it out :)"
294,"Delicious omakase with the freshly grated wasabi. Once you go fresh, you can't go back. I had been here many years ago for a birthday meal and had not been back since. Went on Labor Day Saturday and was pleasantly surprised to find a very short wait. Service was great up until the end when even though they were closed for lunch hours (2ish) they were trying to get us to leave so they could seat one more group in our spot."
295,This is a pretty popular sushi restaurants in South Bay. We came as a big group on a weekday for lunch. You need to be here before noon to get a table without wait.Parking: Very small lot you may need to find street parkingWait: Expect to wait as it gets really during rush hours. They do not take reservations and won't seat you until whole party is there. Service:The staff is great - fast and friendlyFood:  Food was excellent - sushi was fresh and the flavor was light and clean. The tempura was very light you can't tell the oil is not overused. The chirashi sushi bowl was a great deal and the Tomi roll was a delight.Recommendations: Everything! I'd recommend the special nigiri - it was great!
296,"Definitely worth the wait. Sushi was fresh: traditional offerings, nothing out of the norm or special. All in all, a solid restaurant. Service: quick to get you sat, but not a lot of attention after that. Bonus: they have fresh wasabi"
297,"My regular sushi spot in the South Bay! Quality is exceptional and I have yet to try anything on their menu or specials that disappoints.Ambiance: moderately sized, cozy, bustling (there is always a line out the door for lunch and dinner).Food: scrumptious! Tempuras are fried lightly without being too greasy, nigiris are generous with a great fish to rice ratio, chirashi fish cuts are fresh, grilled items are well-charred despite sauce drizzle. Service: attentive but non-intrusive - waters and teas are always refilled timely.Value: great! You get what you pay for in terms of quality and portion sizes without breaking the bank.  Its a Mountain View gem I have and will keep going back to."
298,"I've been here before in non-COVID times and it was good. The sushi was fresh and very reasonably priced. I came back recently now with COVID restrictions, which basically means ""takeout only"". The food was still excellent. Ordering ahead is easy, assuming you can get through on their telephone line. I had to call 5 times to get through to place my order. Nonetheless, the food was ready on time, the line was long but moved quickly, and appropriate social distancing measures were taken."
299,"My coworker suggested I try out Sushi Tomi. My friends and I came here for dinner. The wait time wasn't too bad for the Bay Area! I ordered the combo dinner: teriyaki salmon and gyoza. My dinner came with rice, miso soup and salad. I also ordered a dragon roll. My friends ordered: beef teriyaki (big portion of the beef teriyaki), california roll, extra special nigiri sushi and caterpillar roll. We ate with our eyeballs to say the least! The food and service was good! We will come back again!"
300,"The food is fine. The older Japanese lady is so rude.  I tried to order food online but I just went to the restaurant because nobody was picking up the phone. When I told the lady that I want to order takeout, she asked me ""you order now?"" like I am doing something nonsense. So I told her that I called but nobody picked up the phone, and she said ""no.everybody order phone. okay?"" twice. She treated me like a liar even though I wasn't complaining but just answering her question. She was pretty rude after that too. I know this is not a serious problem and other people there never treated me like that before, and I am saying customers are king. But I hope the older lady doesn't treat people like that in the future."
301,Got here a few minutes before the opener at 5 and wow I'm glad I did. The place filled up almost immediately. The cut hand rolls and nigiri are awesome. My parents enjoyed the shrimp and veggie tempura. Will definitely come back next time I'm back in Mountain View.
302,"Sushi Tomi is a great sushi place that's a little off Castro St. It opens at 5pm, we came around 5:30pm on a Sunday night and managed to get seats right away. By the time we left, there were 6-7 groups waiting outside to be seated... this place definitely gets packed so come early!The sushi at Tomi goes down very easily. They have just the right rice:fish ratio and the fish is very fresh! I really loved the raw sushi; we also tried the bomb special (I think) which was fried, but it's not as fresh and satisfying as the raw sushi. I generally don't like nigiri, but I liked the ones they served here so maybe I've just never had good nigiri before :).Some of our favorite maki rolls were: Tomi special (tried both salmon and spicy tuna), and spicy salmon roll. We ordered about 9 items, which came out to ~$90 without tax/tip. It's a little expensive but worth the price. The service was average, and most of the servers have shaky English so be clear. They also don't refill water unless you ask for it, but that's written in the front of the restaurant."
303,"Great sushi, but everyone knows it. Place is always backed even if come right when doors open."
304,"Ordered $28 Omakase Bento which is not worth it, so disappointed!! The portion is small, ginger was missing, low quality for the price I paid. Wish I went to Japanese supermarket to buy sushi instead of going to this place. This is probably my first and last time eating here..."
305,"Been going to this sushi tomi location for more than 5 years already. The sushi is always on point. I always go for all the extra special (nigiri and chirashi). It's a little bit pricier, but well worth the extra $$$. They have fresh wasabi here as well, if you want to splurge. :)"
306,I probably ordered wrong. I sat at the bar and was really stoned.I should have just omakase some sushi or sashimi but I confusingly selected a rainbow roll and an eel roll (and a small salad). Nothing was bad (but nothing was good either) and it appeared to be presented sloppily on the plate. The guys beside me had beautiful looking fish coming to them expertly prepared by the head chef. Meh. I would go back but I'm not running.
307,You get ridiculously little for the huge price. I bought 3 items with 6 pieces of sushi each for $50. What gives!? Not my wallet anymore
308,We had today great hamachi rolls and teriyaki chicken. It was delicious. Can't wait until we come back.
309,"First thing you might notice is that there's a long line, and for good reason too. The sushi here is so fresh that it melts in your mouth. How melting in your mouth and freshness correlate I don't know, it's just good. Next thing you will notice is that it is not cheap here, so be ready to pay more.So what do you get here? Sushi and sashimi duh. Just.. don't settle for a california roll. Go for a sashimi dinner or okamase or anything really (except for the previously mentioned roll). And while you're here, it may do some good to know how to eat nigiri where the fish part touches the tongue first. And try not to mix soy sauce and wasabi together, save that for the cheaper sushi places.So I realized the last paragraph made me sound snooty about sushi, but come here! It's delicious!"
310,"This place seemed to always be crowded, but I can honestly see why!The fish was just AMAZING!  I wasn't disappointed by an of the dishes we had.  While the wait took about 1.5 hours, it was worth it.We ordered the Special Nigiri, Grilled Salmon Collar and the Sweet Shrimp Sushi.Special Nigiri: The special nigiri had 6 hand-cut tuna rolls, Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Eel, Cooked Shrimp, Salmon Roe and another sushi.  I forgot what the last one was but it was really good as well!  The Eel, I would say, is one of the most tender, meaty, and well-marinaded eel I've ever had! It just melted in my mouth!  The other fishes were also fatty, thick-cut and was just super delicious. Grilled Salmon Collar: Wow. This is just an appetizer you can never go wrong with.  It was a big grilled salmon collar and the salmon skin was just super crunchy and complemented super well with the perfectly cooked salmon!  The salmon was flakey and juicy.  I could probably eat this everyday and not get tired of it.Sweet Shrimp Sushi: I was really attracted to this dish because not only do you get the sweet shrimp sushi, but you also get its deep fried shrimp head!  It was fried and well-seasoned enough for us to consume without any issues.The prices were definitely typical for a great sushi restaurant, but it's totally worth it.  I'd come back for the Chirashi and their udon selections."
311,"Went to Sushi Tomi with my boyfriend on a Saturday night, as we had had it recommended by many people.. I have hurt my leg so I was on crutches, and the staff were so friendly and let me sit in a private room, as we had to wait.. After waiting around 30 minutes, we got a table.. We ordered some bento boxes, a special roll and some seaweed.. Everything tasted super great and was fresh and delicious!! I have only very nice recommendations about this place - and especially their friendly attitude towards me on crutches.."
312,"Went to Sushi Tomi with my boyfriend on a Saturday night, as we had had it recommended by many people..

Everything tasted super great and was fresh and delicious!! I have only very nice recommendations about this place - and especially their friendly attitude towards me on crutches.."
313,We have been to some excellent sushiya's in Japan and Sushi Tomo serves sushi of comparable quality. Lovely food and experience.
314,"Some of the best Sashimi I've ever experienced. 12 assorted pieces, fresh, cold, tasty. Tomi is on a side street to all the action in Downtown Mt. View, easy to park. Get their early for lunch as by noon there was literally a line out the door and a waiting list. Despite the line we never felt rushed so they could turn the table.I'll be back"
315,"Prices have gone up quite a bit in the last few years, but the food is still excellent"
316,I had the three item lunch special and all three items were fresh and delicious. Great portions and great quality food!
317,"I've heard of this place,  and I finally was able to go check it out. The restaurant itself isn't very big, and not on Castro Street, so it's a little bit more quiet. I think our group of 5 got lucky, since we got here around 11:45am on a weekday, and didn't have to wait for a table. Phew!The fish here is VERY fresh. I decided to splurge on the $30 nigiri special for my lunch and it was good! The salmon, shiro, and hamachi were very good - almost melts in your mouth. The uni (which was what enticed me to get the special) was fresh, but a small piece. It also came with a maki roll, which was a nice touch. Service overall was pretty good, and the place is clean. If there is not too long of a wait, then this restaurant is totally worth it. Hard to beat fresh sashimi!!"
318,"The boy and I arrived around 6:30pm on a Monday evening and upon seeing no crowd outside Sushi Tomi, I feared that it was closed, since I always see a line outside the restaurant. Fortunately, it just so happened that the wait was short--after 5-10 minutes, we got a table for two. The restaurant is small and fills up with the sound of chatter, as one is in close quarters with fellow diners. We ordered the classics: the dragon, caterpillar, and rainbow rolls, and also splurged on toro nigiri. I can see why people like Sushi Tomi, as the fish tasted fresh, though it's not so outstanding that I would wait more than 30 minutes for it. Staff appeared quickly to take our order as well as provide the check after we demolished our rolls (which amounted to ~$30 per person), so it was altogether a very swift experience."
319,"Girl's night dinner for six was well worth the 30 minute wait! Even though it was late around 8PM, we were able to get seated and finish dinner before they closed.I called ahead to let them know that a party of six would be coming in soon while I was driving there, and the lady on the phone was very friendly and said that it seemed to be fine and we would be seated with a wait, but without a problem. So true! We were starving by the time we were seated in their back room area by the kitchen/restrooms.We started off our meal with green teas all around and some edamama and seaweed salad. Our server was a friendly and awesome waitress who was not obtrusive, and totally got our orders right! We marked off a bunch of sushi rolls on the paper menu, and ordered a couple of salads in addition. For the six of us, we were able to walk away full and satisfied with our tummies filled with delicious sushi, for about $20 per person after tax and tip!! AMAZING.I loved the rainbow roll and other sashimi-centered ones, but felt that the spider roll's 4 pieces were a little small for the value. Portion-size was alright considering we basically ordered a feast for our table, and I loved when it all came out on one huge beautiful plate! I didn't think that the sushi was too rice-forward, as most places are...but I wish the sashimi cuts on the rolls were larger in size. In order to get what you paid for, I think the best option is to come with a large group and order hella rolls! We almost ordered all of the sushi rolls off of their special roll menu, and I don't regret any part of it. Warm space, lots of lighting, and a great place for a girl's dinner!"
320,Come early! We arrived at 5:30pm and there was already a huge line outside by 6:30pm! The joint is not that big and thus not super ideal for larger parties.I tried the nabeyaki udon and the ochazuke with ikura. I liked the dishes. I liked how chewy the udon noodles were and the broth was tasty. the fried tempura was decent but I've had better. The ochazuke was good and portion size was decent. I thought the ikura salmon roe tasted fresh. The ochazuke broth changes depending on which one you get!My fiancé wasn't a huge fan of the chirashi. He thought it was okay tier sushi and not worth the money.
321,"I really enjoyed Sushi Tomi - I came here with my friends for lunch. It's a nice and small restaurant located near downtown mountain view - so parking is a bit hard.I like the lunch set because they give you such THICK and NICE pieces of sashimi in addition to soup, salad and rice. Hot tea is also complimentary for you to chow down :-)))I would definitely come again. I just wished that we were explained the different types of fishes... because I wasn't sure about one of them... - but nothing was fishy or smelly. FRESH AND DELICIOUS!"
322,"Not to get confused with Tomi Sushi, this place is just right around the corner of downtown Mountain View.It is VERY packed.  I had to run to beat other people walking to this place to put my name on the wait list for table of four.  We had one person show up late, but the lady let us sit down even though there was just three of us.Menu is very simple.  One sheet, double sided.  One special menu.  And small list to just order just the sashimi and sushi.I got the combination thinking it was going to be smaller portion.  BOY.  WAS.  I.  WRONG.  These were GIANT portions.  Salad, Miso soup and Rice were small.  But both my Gyoza and Tonkatsu had their own plates.  I was thinking I was going to be hungry afterwards, so I ordered Caterpillar roll.  I ended up giving my friends some of the roll and taking home my combination home with me.  SO much food.The Omakase was super tempting to order.  The sashimi and nigiri was extremely tasty and really meaty.  Maybe when I go next time and sit at the bar.Understanding why its so packed here, there are a lot of tables to fit a lot of people.  But its also cramped.  I saw a kid almost take out a waitress by accident.  I think the worst part is that he didn't apologize or the family didn't say anything.  And the waitress was clearly upset, but she held it together and kept working.  On top of giving us really great service, I felt really bad that she could have been seriously injured.  I tipped her a lot.I'm only docking one star because the wait was rather long.  But the food and staff are amazing.  I highly suggest coming here."
323,"A stellar sushi place in Mountain View.  I've only been here for dinners, and even when they are busy, it's worth the wait. Just leave your name on the list and chat with your friends while you pass the time.The Tomi special roll is superb. Sashimi dinner is fresh and delicious.  I'll have to try their bento lunches one day. Looks so good in the photos."
324,"We went there just a bit before 1pm, and I peeked in. The lady asked us whether it's for take out, and I replied ""Dine in"". And somehow she got angry and yelled out ""we are closing now"". I asked ""do you close at 1""? And she said ""yeah, we are closing at 1 today!"". It was a bit disappointing for us and her ""I don't care and go away"" look didn't help... I thought at least show some empathy to your hungry customers and be nicer? Is that a lot to ask...?"
325,"+1 for sashimi lunch today and got the dish isn't as good as before. You can check the photo, least piece and quality wasn't good. It's a bit disappointed, I come here every week, at least once a week, but today has bad quality and I paid extra $1. Not sure what's going on, usually food and sushi are good, especially when I pay extra money to change one item of lunch deal. But not today!"
326,"Regular Chirashi bowl was good, but I am gonna order salmon sashimi next time as I liked it the most. Surprisingly, beef teriyaki was very good too, one of the best I have tried so far. Place is very authentic, and the location is very good. Lines are crazy if you come during popular hours, so be prepared to wait outside. Prices are high, but it is expected."
327,"We've heard good things about Sushi Tomi from reliable sources, came once but was discouraged by the line outside and left...what a mistake that was. Luckily we were smarter this time; I was a little skeptical when the nice hostess said 20 minutes as we put our name down (and with at least a dozen people waiting outside), turned out she was right; we were seated in about 15.Service was very prompt, efficient, polite but since it's a very busy place you are expected to know what to order without a whole lot of help.  We started by ordering a chef's special sashime appetizer ($29), a dragon roll ($11.50) and grilled hamachi kama ($13.50)The sashime came shortly after the hot tea was served, must admit that we were a little disappointed by the portion size. The fifteen pieces were  either thin or thicker but short, what made it up was the quality of the fish, they were indeed fresh, smooth and sweet. We saw the Chirashi Sushi (extra special) on the next table, for a dollar more looked much more substantial.  The dragon roll was good but about half the size of some other places (4 pieces instead of 6 or 8) again we told ourselves it's the quality that count but decided we need a least another roll. The spider roll ($11.50) although also came in 4 pieces had to be the best we've tasted. The soft shell crab was hot, crispy, fresh and juicy; we also like the fact that they don't overload you with the rice around it. They saved the best for the last, the hamachi kama was sooo good, perfectly grilled, plump, juicy and super fresh, the best we've tasted in quite a while. Glad we finally tried Sushi Tomi and will definitely be back to try other dishes."
328,Great sushi and portions! Their spicy tuna roll sad killer. Sushi recommend it!Also really liked the veggie tempura. Well cooked.
329,"Had dinner with visiting relatives from out of town yesterday, as usual sashimi is always very fresh, unfortunately the beef in my sukiyaki was very over cooked. On top of the beef being overcooked, I also found a piece of the cooked plastic wrapping material about 3/4"" long in the sukiyaki as well!  I asked the server for the manager, she said that the manager is not there, I showed her the cooked piece of plastic wrap and told her that the kitchen staff need to be extra careful with food handling; she apologized and said that it's probably the wrapper from the food and took it away with the finished dishes.  I didn't want to make a big deal out of it since we were there with visiting relatives, but I think management should know about this and make some improvements when incidents like this occurred. I don't know if the server was trying to minimize their error, I don't think it's possible that there's no management on site when the restaurant is in operation!  In any case, I would have to think twice before I would go back again, maybe just at the sushi bar, nothing cooked from the kitchen!"
330,"I have tried this place about 3-4 times now and I don't quite understand what the hype is but it's ok. My 4 star rating is based on that delicious bento box I devoured right after my workout. For $12 & change you can get a bento with sashimi which includes salmon and tuna unlike just 1 sashimi you get at most places, salmon teriyaki which was quite tasty and then the usual rice, miso, salad and orange. I felt satisfied after the meal because that was exactly what I wanted. I have tried rolls here but according my taste buds they are just ok. They have this bomb nigori which is so worth it specially during lunch hour"
331,"The line outside on a Wednesday night caught my eye. Then I saw the multiple chalkboards of specials of seasonal offerings, with some fish of which I had never heard. Then I saw they had a $48 omakase, so I treated myself to a course! Lemme just say, whatever is in the live octupus sashimi tastes better than candy. You get 14 pieces or so (aji, shima aji, abalone, uni, whitefish, octupus, etc. Although the restaurant was busy I felt the service was great. Respect the hustle, especially if the food is actually great!"
332,"Sushi Tomi has consistently delivered high quality food including fresh seafood, hot-cooked dishes, and excellent service. Their fish is always so tender, never chewy or strongly scented (within reason). Their lunch specials are a great deal, and they offer a variety of options to ensure you can try a new combination nearly anytime you go! I highly recommend this place to anyone that enjoys authentic Japanese food. However, be sure to order ahead of time for pick up or arrive early because it can get very busy!"
333,Favorite sushi place in Bay Area. Their fish is fresh and servers are always so friendly. Lunch bentos are a great deal and the tomi special roll melts in your mouth!
334,"I was really excited to try this place after all of the good things I've heard and all the Yelp reviews. Came here on a Friday at 5:45pm and had to wait for around 45 min to get a seat for 2. The spread:- Chazuke w/ salmon roe: I've had better but it was decent here, very light and refreshing- Rolls: We got a few of the special rolls (can't remember the names) but they were average- Nigiri: We ordered salmon, hotate, and amaebi. I was pretty disappointed by the quality of the fish, didn't taste very fresh, especially the hotate. We received all of the nigiri at the same time, but the amaebi head didn't come until 10+ minutes later, and when it did come, it was completely cold.- Beef tongue skewers: Sounded amazing at the time I was ordering it, but both my friend and I couldn't even bite through the beef. The cut was way too thick and it was also overcooked. It's extremely rare that I send items back to the kitchen, but I sent this one back because it was basically inedible.Sad to have had such a bad experience here. In my opinion there are much better options in the area for similar prices, so unfortunately I won't be back."
335,"First time coming to this restaurant. It's almost in the middle of downtown Mountain View. And yes they are right about the small parking so come here early. We came here just before it opened and there was already another person in line. The people let us in and seated us near the window. The interior design looks nice inside. Don't let the exterior fool you. There is a sushi bar also. As we seated, they gave us our menus. A lady kindly asked us what to order and of course gotta have Sapporo w/ my sushi. Looking at the menu they have a lot to choose from. I ended up ordered their sashimi dinner platter and also sake and hamachi nigiri pieces. You get 2 pieces for 1 order. I mistakenly ordered 2 of each. I got way more than I can finish. I say this because when they came out I was so happy at how big the pieces of fish were. The sashimi platter was alright, nice big pieces also, but it seemed a bit defrosted. I couldn't finish one of the last bits because of it. So it wasn't quite as fresh. Nigiri pieces though I liked. I don't know if there is wasabi in the rice already, but it tasted good with it. We also tried their fried oysters! It was good. Usually you don't get much oyster. The mustard wasabi sauce it's served with paired well. The fried oysters were breaded well and crispy. Ask them if they can give you lemon since I forgot to.Overall, it's not the greatest but their price seem decent for the size of fish you get. The ambience is pretty good because the servers were really friendly and they even gave us an appetizer on the house. Just be warned that if you don't get here early enough they really get packed and a line starts to form. It's because they don't have as much seating and big parties of people usually come from what I saw."
336,"As my girl says ""Fresh sashimi is one thing that won't fail you in life"". Sushi tomi definitely won't let you down. If you want fresh sashimi come here! Very hospitable hosts. I will caution to be careful when drinking the miso soup as it has fish bones. I recommend the Tomi bento as it has a lot of food and let's you sample their salmon sashimi pieces. My girl got the regular chirashi bowl and she loved it as well. Keep it up Sushi Tomi, we will be back!"
337,The Chirashi is great! The rice isn't over seasoned. The fish is fresh. Perfect portion as well.
338,"Be careful when ordering to go! This place serve me burnt Kara age chicken, I check my order until I arrived home, I had to toss out my order! The audacity to serve burnt food to their customers shows a lot!"
339,"favorite sushi place in all of mtn view, authentic soft fresh fish and beautiful simple rolls. expensive but what can u do we're in a recession lmao"
340,Came here last month. We called several times before it went through. Better call early. They are very busy. Pick up had a long line too. It took 15-20 minutes to get my order. My daughter really like her salmon sashimi. My husband says the grilled mackerel was juicy.
341,"WOW!! What a pleasant surprise!  Now I totally understand why this place has a wait and is always busy.The Sashimi Lunch was one of the BEST - no IS THE BEST I've ever had!  For $16.90 you get a salad, soup (which was perfect, lots of tofu and seaweed and not overly salty).  For the plate of Sashimi - you get 3 pieces each of salmon, yellow tail and white tuna and 2 pieces of tuna! OH MY... the sashimi MELTS in your mouth - so FRESH, big pieces.  I was stuffed - and savoring every bite!Service was fast, attentive and impeccable.  The only complaint I have is the tables are so close together that the table next to us had a rather LOUD gentlemen that needed to learn to use his ""inside voice"".  We had to ask him to quiet down.Other than that - I can't wait to go back!!  So glad I finally get to try this place!  Now I know the hype is real!! :)"
342,"Most delicious sashimi I've had!+ Special Chirashi Bowl 10/10+ Sashimi Dinner 10/10I was in a rush to get home so I ordered takeout instead, calling in at around 5:20pm on a Tuesday. Yelp says it opens at 5:30 but you can call in to place an order first. We got our order within 15 minutes.The sashimi was absolutely amazing; never had fish that would melt in my mouth like this. Both the chirashi and sashimi dinner had a wide variety of different fish; although the sashimi dinner cost less (around $23), I enjoyed this more than the chirashi because it had more salmon!Both come with miso soup, and the sashimi dinner also comes with a side salad.Unequivocally one of the best places sushi places in the Bay Area, go go go!"
343,"This place is meh. Fish wise I will never get it again, other bento stuff is ok. The lunch special prices are worth it, but full price definitely not. The fish is not that fresh; it's all very watery as if it's just been defrosted. Not the worst sushi / sashimi I've ever had but definitely close to the bottom. We ordered the $15 toro (2 pcs) and both us and our friends couldn't eat it due to has bad it was. For the lunch special price I guess it's ok (sashimi bento has 11 pieces for $16), but the full price is expensive and the quality does not justify it (you can get much better sushi for the same price elsewhere).Save yourself the money and go to Sushi Sam's in San Mateo for actual quality and fresh fish. Or Seiya in San Carlos. Or Izakaya Kou in SF."
344,"Sushi Tomi has always been my families favorite sushi place so we decided to get take out for lunch today! We had three 4 item bentos which was really worth the price given how much delicious food it includes - saba shioyaki, various tempura, teriyaki chicken, and sashimi - all for $17! It was delicious as always. The teriyaki chicken had good flavor and was tender, tempura was a little greasy but still crispy and came with the usual sauce. The other meal ordered was katsu curry which is one of the specials. The katsu was tender and not dry. The curry had beef and other veggies in it and was very flavorful. Overall great meal all together! Glad to be able to help keep our favorite sushi restaurant floating despite the pandemic."
345,Sushi Tomi is an option when your craving sushi.  As a vegetarian there are extremely few options and this place didn't really meet the mark.  Even the agadashi tofu as an appetizer had bonito flakes even when we informed the waitstaff we are vegetarian.  Great vibe and energetic atmosphere still make it fun to visit when going out with friends who are sushi lovers.  I think their regular sushi options may be OK.  Try sake or Japanese beer while you're here for the full palate experience.
346,"Have been coming here for years especially during the pandemic. However, today I got some takeouts and felt the quality has gotten worse. Got today's special poke salad. The poke taste like scrap sashimi, not very good cut of fish and even found a big bone in one piece. The seasoning is also underwhelming. Also got our usual bento box with salmon sashimi. The sashimi slices are very very thin. Overall all the item price went up like everything else these days. Very disappointed!"
347,This is my first time in Tomi. To test out the quality of the fish I ordered the Sashimi Omakase. It contains 9 different kinds of fish/shell fish. All of them are special fish not the regular salmon and tuna. Not a big fan of abalone personally even though it is a special item.The Tomi special roll is amazing. I like the torched fatty salmon on top. This is not the 100+ dollar Omakase so don't expect the same level of food. But it is pretty good for the price. I'd like to try their lunch sometime too since they are more affordable
348,"Sometimes I go to this Japanese restaurant and I get one of the specials ,it's a hit or miss.Sometimes I love everything and sometimes it's not great or portions extremely small or lacking.There more expensive items are way overpriced ani feel ripped off,like the Omakase Chef specials,there was Nothing special about it,it was a waste of 50 dollar and I will Never order it again.Their lunch specials are sometimes reasonable priced and good.Dinner expect to be a little more pricier.This Japanese restaurant is right in the middle,I sometimes like it but many times it's not the best."
349,"Tempura, Takoyaki, Sashima, and Steak combo were amazing!  10/10 would come back here."
350,Delicious sushi! We got lucky with getting seated right away. Friendly staff and chill atmosphere.  Has Limited parking since it's in downtown Mountain View
351,They are offering pick up during COVID. The quality of the fish is great. I loved the sashimi dinner I got. I do wish the menu had more special rolls because that's always my go to for sushi.
352,Come early - like when it opens to avoid a long wait (yes that applies to week nights too). So glad I was only eating for one so I get to eat at the sushi bar. I love watching the chef prep sushi and I also use this as an opportunity to see what fresh catch he recently got. There is an omakase spread that you can get for $45 and that isn't bad at all! For ten pieces of chef selection (this is delicious) and definitely order side pieces like their ebi and wagyu. The only feedback I gave the chef was to use less rice. Perhaps his audience likes to feel stuffed but I think a little less rice would have been perfect. I love all pieces and I got an extra three pieces of fish. I will be back for sure now that I found you!
353,"Everyone who's been here knows that the sushi is good... but if you haven't tried the Nabeyaki Udon yet, you need to.It comes with blanched spinach, a poached egg, a generous amount of chicken, and shrimp & vegetable tempura. The broth is deeply flavorful and udon is silky and has just the right amount of chew. The chicken is always tender. I've ordered the udon sometimes with negihama maki over 20 times now.This doesn't happen too often, but some days the broth will have some scum on top and the chicken will still have skin on it... I normally don't have problems with chicken skin, but I think because the donabe (pot) stays so hot, it melts the chicken skin into mush. It hasn't happened recently and am hoping the problem has been nipped for good."
354,"This is our go-to sushi place. We usually go here for lunch and as long as we get there right when it opens, then there's no wait. Otherwise, you're pretty much sol and gotta wait. Looks like they recently put out some water and tea in the front, so it should be a little more pleasant.We typically get the Sashimi Lunch and Sushi Lunch combos. They're just the right amount of food for the right price. The sashimi is always super fresh and the salmon we could just eat day after day. The complimentary hot green tea is also really good--sometimes the refills can be watery, though.If you have an infant/toddler, be wary that there are only two high chairs available, with some booster seats available as well."
355,Sushi Tomi's sushi is bad and the service is horrible. They will either not take your order or make you wait for an hour for some really bad sushi!!Their service is just horrible and very arrogant!!!
356,Somehow I felt that the restaurant is completely different than the one I had a few years back. The food was not authentic Japanese but the price is. The service was bad and so rushed. I would not want to visit again.
357,"We are a frequent patrons to Sushi Tomi!  Our kids love this place!  They get really busy for and lunch and dinner, so they probably won't care what I am going to write in this review.Once in awhile our kids loves to make sushi at home and because good sushi rice is hard to achieve, we would order 4-5 bowls of sushi rice from them.  Never have a problem ordering.Today when I called in for 5 bowls of sushi rice, the lady was giving me a hard time and won't let me order.  When I told her we order all the time, she came back and said this will be the last time.  Mind you the sushi rice is NOT free and NOT cheap!  Just note that we have ordered 5 bowls of sushi rice before and the box of rice were never this skimpy!  Geez, we are only talking about RICE!We picked up the order and they gave us an equivalent of 3 bowls of sushi rice.  You know your bowl of sushi rice is not free and it's $3 a bowl!  We cannot believe they would not honor and provide the food we actually paid for!!!  Be ware when you order to go!It's too bad... this will also be our last time."
358,"This restaurant is located downtown Mountain View.  We got here 5 mins before opening for lunch on Saturday, we were the 3rd party in line and got seated right away.  Our server was excellent!  We ordered - Unagi Don - $18.90 a bit pricey, but worth it.  It came with 4 decent size una- Mix Don - asked for no tuna; got 4 pieces of Hamachi & 5 pieces of Salmon   It was delicious - worth - $18.90- lunch bento combo - $12.90 - ok- tempura udon - fineThe sashimi was good, our server was very attentive and nice.Will definitely come back again."
359,"Scary experience here today.   I asked the waitress (young with glasses) what was in the chirashi bowl and she said ""a bunch of mixed fish"".  I asked her to elaborate since I am allergic to a couple kinds and she replied ""it's just a bunch of fish mixed together but if you want you can get something else.""I figured I could just identify the fish that I was allergic to if it was included so I ordered it.  The bowl also came with what seemed to be a fried California roll, but when I ate it the meat was warm.  I asked the waitress if there was crab in the roll (usually it's simply white fish) and she told me it was a mix of real and fake crab.  Umm crab is one of the few fish I am allergic to!   I told her this and asked why she didn't break down what was in the dish and she shrugged it off and walked away.I was so panicked I went home to try to take an antihistimine in time (tho I'm also breastfeeding so this was not an ideal choice).  I called to give feedback back to the business and the man manning the lines simply passed me back to my waitress who kept saying she didn't know that this would be a problem.  Really horrified by the lack of concern of customers with health allergies and lack of feedback to management.  I would be wary to come here again based on this experience."
360,The quality of the fish always exceeds our ever increasing expectations. Hands down the best sushi in the bay - also the best I've ever had.
361,"When I got into the restaurant there were 3 people at the Host area and didn't greet us at all. Then after about a minute they looked at us and said ""for three?"" Then when we sat down the server wasn't very friendly either. I ordered Sushi and the crab tasted old and gritty! The ginger they put on my plate was also old and dried up. The person who rolled it must have been learning because the rice was inside the sushi (looked like a mistake) and a little bit out of the Sushi. The bento box was also not that great. I'm not sure how this place has so many stars and great reviews. I would never come back again. Don't let me forget to leave out that for two people (no beverages just water) 2 Sushi roles and 1 Bento box was $52....."
362,"This is really a 4.5 Star review! Sushi Tomi sushi is among one of the most consistently good sushi in the area. I love the extra special nigiri or the extra special chirashi bowl and they even fry the head of sweet shrimp for you!I also love their special nigiris on the white board, some of my favorites are the hamachi toro (yellowtail belly) and salmon belly. The only reason I knock off half a star is their cooked food is just ok, and wouldn't get twice. But I would recommend all the fresh fish.One thing though please add online ordering, I always have to fight to get through the phone line for like 20min haha, but worth it every time.Must try:extra special nigiri,extra special chirashi,yellowtail belly nigiri,salmon belly nigiri,good value:rainbow roll"
363,"Exceptional sushi! High quality fish and other ingredients. This place usually has a long wait, but you can put your name down and walk around outside. It is worth the wait!"
364,"Nice good restaurant during the COVID time, which is rare to find Love their extra special sushi except the tuna piece (don't like tuna taste  personal preference)"
365,"Sushi Tomi is easily one of the best sushi places around in the Bay Area. My family and I have been coming here for years, and the quality of their fish and hot food has not changed one bit. Do note that with their growing popularity, you can expect a wait time of at least 20-30 minutes unless you arrive early.They have a standard selection of sushi and cooked food. Their Salmon, Hamachi, Amaebi, Uni, and Scallop sushi are all super fresh. Their Amaebi also includes the fried heads, which are always delicious! There is also an option to get the Toro cuts of the Salmon and Hamachi, but I have found that the regular cuts are already so high quality that the Toro cuts are not worth the extra cost.Their Tempura Udon and Spider Roll are also very tasty! The udon is chewy, and the tempura consists of shrimp and different vegetables. The Spider Roll is a classic that is super well prepared here.Sushi Tomi is definitely worth the wait for its price and quality of food!"
366,This is our go-to place when we're craving sushi. Excellent rolls and omakase sashimi/nigiri options.
367,"We moved to the Bay Area 5y ago and Sushi Tomi is our happy place where we eat at least 2/3 times a month.During these years we tried many sushi places and no one is comparable to Tomi when looking at the price-quality.We always get 2 extra special nigiri sushi (our favorite! as it includes uni and sake/tuna toro) rainbow roll, sushi Tomi sake and salmon avocado.Even after visiting Japan we could tell that Tomi offers nothing less than the sushi we had there.This is going to be your fav!"
368,"Came on a Thursday evening and saw that this place must be good considering there was a wait when there were many sushi restaurants in downtown Mountain View without one. I put my name down for a party of two around 7, and got seated around 20-30 minutes later. Get here early if you want to avoid the wait.Ordered the clam miso soup and seaweed salad to start - which were both pretty good, but typical - and decided to splurge on the omakase sashimi for my entree. When I was brought the assortment, I asked what everything was and the server couldn't even tell me. It was an interesting mix of textures, but it all seemed pretty fresh though I did get some chewy cuts of the meat. Next time, I'll stick to things I know so I can more accurately judge the quality."
369,"I got the dinner combination special (2 entrees + soup + salad + rice), initially thinking it was pretty expensive ($18.90) but it ended up being great value, a lot of food for the price! For the entrees, I got the tuna and salmon sashimi, which portion-wise was more than I expected for a combination special, as well as the chicken teriyaki, which left me fuller than I usually get at sushi restaurants. I even had leftovers!The service was quite good as well, and the restaurant is nice and clean. Don't be fooled if there seems to be a long line of people waiting outside; they just don't have waiting room inside, so everyone waits outside to be seated. We got seated in around 10-15 min on a Saturday night, which was fine since we spent that time looking at the menu and deciding what to get anyways :)"
370,I used to live a block away from Sushi Tomi and am a frequent patron. Sushi Tomi offers solid and decent quality sushi and other Japanese offerings. I've been to a lot of sushi restaurants in the Bay Area; this is one of my favorites.
371,Pricy but worth itVery fresh fishTea is very goodMy favorite sushi place in mountain view
372,"Here is really amaging! All Sushi are made by Japanese chef. I discovered Sushi which is delicious like as famous restaurant in Japan.I had a special nigiri sushi 25$ Very delicious and beautiful!!Be careful here is very crowded because of popular, it is good arrving early time."
373,"The waitress was super pushy. We barely sat down and she rushed over and said are you ready to order. This kept happening every minute or so. I understand that they are trying to turn the table quickly, but it was extremely rushed. Before I even finished my food, she hovered over me and asked if she could take my plate.Fish quality is fine, but I wish the service could be less pushy so we could enjoy our meal."
374,"Expect a wait! This place is small and pretty popular. No Yelp waitlist, writing down phone numbers, or any tech so you'll have to wait outside until your name gets called. I've only had the chirashi here. The original chirashi ($20) is good but the serving size is relatively small, and I'm usually hungry for more food after scarfing it down it. If they have a mini chirashi special (~$12), then expect something like a poke bowl with mini sashimi. The server we had yesterday seemed to be in a bad mood and taking it out on us. I asked him how big the mini chirashi was and how many pieces of sashimi we can expect, and he curtly gave a non-answer, ""whatever the chef feels like,"" with attitude which caught us by surprise. All the other servers seem nice and friendly."
375,"We were not super confident about taking out sushi dishes as we always had sushi at the restaurants. However it has been a bit too long so we took a shot from the place we thought to be one of the best around here. Everything was delicious and we had great dinner. Then my wife got sick, vomited all through the night. I'm also not feeling too well in the stomach  this morning although it's not even close to what my wife went through last night. We suspect it might have been that single piece of uni maki. It didn't look the best but we trusted the restaurant. A bad idea. Very very disappointed."
376,"I would like to give it a 3.5 Star. Considering the area around it, the sushi here is above average but not amazing though. I care a lot about sushi rice - the flavor and size. This place does not serve the rice well. Most fish I had was fresh. The sea urchin (uni) is a little bit bad. Glad that they serve abalone here."
377,The freshness of fish was fine. But the chef cut them in somewhat thick pieces. The toro sashimi was very hard to chew...and the rice was not well prepared and flavored
378,"Maybe the best deal when it comes to sushi on the peninsula. It's not cheap, but absolutely and always fresh fish, crispy tempura, and well made wasabi and pickled ginger. Our go-to sushi!"
379,"Best sushi ever. Definitely worth the wait! The restaurant is fairly small, which contributes to the wait, however, the service is fairly quick. I went in for sushi rolls only and it is designed like a pick and choose menu. You have a paper slip and mark down which sushi and/or rolls you want. Later they bring out all your orders on a giant plate. They are plated very nicely. I got the spicy tuna, dragon roll, & shrimp tempura. So so good. Everything was fresh and soft. Largely portioned also. I don't eat raw fish but the ones we ordered looked so fresh and tasted good by the others. I liked how they incorporated all of the seafood into our meal. For example they deep fried the shrimp heads they used for our sushi. I saw orders of the bento and will try them next time! Again, super quick service and friendly staff. You have to make sure your party is all there to get seated, they wait about 5 min if called and your party is not there yet. There's also a parking lot right across. Best bet is to get here right when they open to avoid a longer wait."
380,"The boyfriend and I came here for our anni and omggg we were amazed at how delicious everything was! We wanted to try everything! Don't be fooled by the exterior, as it looks like a hole in the wall but the inside is far from that. It's small and cozy. We arrived early to put our name down and were first in the list. *They start to let people in 10 minutes early from their opening time!!*Now to the sushi - there is a reason why this place has 2000+ reviews! The slices of fish and crab meat literally melt in your mouth! The salmon sashimi was like butter and they did not skimp on the size. We ordered the Tomi special w/ spicy tuna, rainbow roll and salmon sashimi. And to top it off service was great. We felt a little rushed at the end but NBD the place was packed!! Happy eating!"
381,"Went to Tomi during dinner time. I think the fish is fresh, but a couple of details makes me feel a little bit disappointed...so 3 stars. We ordered regular nigiri set. The tekka roll come along is not really well made....you can see that the side nori is not closed up tightly so the shape looks a little weird. The california roll had the same issue.https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-tomi-mountain-view-2?select=f97rweMnUel2gb4yQFinkAThe plate was far too big compared to the size of sushi. So at the beginning I had an impression that the sushi was smaller. No salmon during that night :'( Did they run out of salmon? My plate has 2 tuna nigiri and 6 tekka...I guess a little too much tuna-ish. But the flavor was great.....fresh fish and bouncy shrimp eggs. Just the shape and plate can do better."
382,"Came here on Sunday for dinner with the GF. GF is a Japanese food fiend, and I work around the corner and always see a long line that I figured we give this place a shot.Place opens right on the dot, if you are looking to get a quick seat, I recommend coming 10-15 minutes early to snag a place in line. On Sunday, we came and waited at 4:50 and was the first in line for opening at 5PM.Tea here is complimentary, so if you want to enjoy a nice green tea, go ham!We ordered the battura mackerel sushi as an appetizer and that was delicious. The mackerel was super tasty and the shishio leaf inside the sushi gave it a very nice bright flavor.My GF ordered the nigiri set. It looked delicious and had a ton of different sushi on it. I ordered the Extra Special Chirashi. It was definitely very good. More filling than i expected. All the fish that we had was very fresh and tasty. Everything was what we would have expected from a good sushi spot."
383,So yummy. The best fresh nigiri selection around! All the toro you could ever want and so buttery good!
384,Amazing sushi for the price point. Been going here for years! Get the combos or omakase
385,"Great Japanese restaurant which, judging by the crowd of people lined up before it even opens, is totally not a secret! My original plan that night had been to grab an easy dinner with my friend at Oren's down the street. Well, as fate would have it, I parked smack dab in front of Sushi Tomi's door, around 15 minutes before they opened. Plan changed. Sushi Tomi has a very comfortable atmosphere, even with the hustle & bustle of a constant stream of people coming in to put their name down on the wait list. Our server, though very busy, managed to keep a very focused (and cheerful!) attention on us while she was at our table. The food, however, was not the best I've had. Everything was great, don't get me wrong, just not ""awesome!!"". We ordered a hamachi kama (normally one of my favorites in any Japanese restaurant), Tomi Special roll with hamachi, and a nigiri special. The hamachi kama was a bit too salty (and unequal in the flavoring), but still good enough to enjoy. The nigiri special featured good fish, but, as others have mentioned, it's not of melt-in-your-mouth quality. The Tomi Speical was much better than expected! I'm not generally a huge fan of rolls, but this is one I would order again. It had a great flavor profile, and you can really taste the different ingredients in it.To sum up - I'd go again, and enjoy it, but the food doesn't quite reach a 5 star height."
386,"I came here a few minutes before they opened on a weekend, and was surprised to see there was a line down the street. There must not be any decent sushi in the area. Come early if you don't want to wait!Honestly, I thought the sushi lunch I ordered was just average. It came with a lot- 5 piece nigiri, 3 piece California roll, 3 piece cucumber roll, 3 piece tuna roll, broccoli, miso soup, and salad. I thought the nigiri was decent but could've been fresher. The California roll was good though! Enough to satisfy my sushi craving, but don't expect anything special."
387,"Service is quick, food is consistently delicious, and the atmosphere is nice as well. Always a recommended spot!"
388,"my favorite sushi place in South Bay. when I lived in Mountain View I came here a lot, but after moving out, haven't been here as much. came back last week and remembered how much I miss it. crowded at lunch, you need to sign up and wait, but worth it. sushi bar seating tooit's a little expensive, especially for lunch, but the fish is really good and service is nice too"
389,"I hate to say this, but I can no longer count Sushi Tomi among my favorites. Predictably, there was the 20 to 30 minute wait outside, causing a buildup of anticipation for delicious sushi. Unpredictability, the Sushi Tomi roll, previously unparalleled to none, was merely ordinary. Gone was the delicate smoky flavor and the tender sushi that melted in the mouth. Instead, the sushi was merely average, causing myself to lament the decline of one of my all-time favorite sushi rolls, ever. Now that the Sushi Tomi roll no longer entices me, I can't envision myself returning soon unless I'm craving a bowl of fresh chirashi. There are simply too many amazing other sushi restaurants in the Bay Area to try."
390,"Sushi Tomi,you are so yummy.Bowls, plates,piles of sashimi,all delivered straight from Tsukiji.Sushi Tomi roll, so delicately charred,no other sushi can top you, no holds barred.Your dinner combination plate,I can never resist.Your portions so large, your grilled mackerel so tasty,...everything is simply delish!"
391,"This never gets old! Their uni is THE BEST. Have to try. The extra special chirashi is really extra special! Love the salmon toro, full size unagi, and sweet shrimp! Love it!!!! Please keep up the great work...will keep coming back!"
392,"Service: 4/5Prompt with being asked what we'd like to drink as soon as we were seated and dishes were quick to arrive.Food: 3/5- Unagi roll was just ok, average- Rainbow roll was a little better than ok, the variety of fish was of decent quality- Special Tomi roll tasted the best out of the rolls we ordered, but it was decent at best. I had a hamachi roll topped with the seared salmon that was nice.- Hirame nigiri was ok- Rice for the rolls wasn't that nicely packed as some pieces would fall apart upon being picked up.Presentation: 2/5It could've been better as the rice looked like it wasn't evenly rolled out for the rolls, making the rolls look a little lop-sided.For an hour wait, this place had the quality of Kenzo but priced higher"
393,"Sushi lovers! Do you ever wish that there was one sushi joint that had the perfect blend of affordability, quantity, and quality? Not gonna lie, it was pretty difficult for me to find one in the South Bay, but I think I've got one. My coworker recommended Sushi Tomi as her favorite spot down near the Peninsula/South Bay and after having it last night, I must tell you that THIS IS THE SPOT!Sushi Tomi is a quaint and cute little Japanese restaurant near Downtown Mountain View. The unique thing about its location is that it's a street down from Castro St, the main part of downtown MV, and so it's quieter and less crowded. Parking can be a pain on weekends but there's plenty of free weekend street parking. I recommend coming early because it can get packed and this place closes at 930. Note: we and around 8pm as a party of 2 and got in within a half an hour.The first thing I noticed about this restaurant was that Sushi Tomi gives off a very cute and intimate vibe. The lighting was not too bright, the space was not too huge, and atmosphere was overall peaceful. The place is divided in two by the counter, and we sat right at the counter next to the chefs. Initially, I was a bit surprised by how small Sushi Tomi's menu was. . For example, Tomi only has a few number of special rolls on their menu, and they have an average amount of generic rolls like toro; they also have several combination plates like sashimi platters and chirashi, but nothing on the scale I've come to see at other Japanese restaurants... but what they lack in extravagant quantity, they OWN in quality. We ended up getting one sushi dinner, a toro roll, one salmon spicy roll, and one Tomi special. Here's how it went...Spicy Salmon Roll (10/10). If I had to describe how GOOD this roll was, I'd say next time I'm here, I'm just ordering 8x plates of this. First off, the salmon was so soft. The rolls were HUGE! If you enjoy spicy, this one is for you; their sriarcha mayo sauce is omg. The best part is that each plate of 6 is ONLY $7!!!Special Tomi Roll (9/10). This one came out last for us after we finished our food, and for good reason because the Tomi Roll is a masterpiece of art. Each roll is filled with your fish of choice (we chose hamachi), and is topped with salmon and scallops. So basically, you have a fish party in your mouth. I liked this Roll a lot - taste was great, presentation on point - but I've definitely had better tasting premium rolls before! For around $14, this is a go!Toro Roll (7/10). Is it bad that I mistakes the Toro Roll for the Tomi Special? Overall, the Toro Roll was decent. The fish wasn't spectacular, and the portions were smaller than the salmon special, but I thought it was worth ordering. I've had better fatty tuna, but I enjoyed this Roll. Nothing too special about this one. It's pretty cheap at $10 even though Toro is getting expensive and rare.Sushi dinner (10/10). Not gonna lie, if you are here for raw fish and don't want to drop $45 for the omakase, the sushi dinner is great! For half the price at $23, you get some hot rice, delicious miso soup, a simple salad, and around 12 pieces of FRESH tuna, Toro, white tuna, and salmon. I guarantee that if you're just eating by yourself, you'll probably be full from this one dinner choice. It's a safe bet and definitely worth your taste buds!Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Sushi Tomi and was glad my coworker recommended this place. The food was amazing, the service was pretty efficient, and the atmosphere was on point. I wouldn't say this was the best Sushi I've ever had, but it was definitely one of the most bang for your buck! I have to say Sushi Tomi deserves an ""Omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this"" because with parking and waiting, you just might have to! Do yourself a favor and try the spicy salmon roll!!!!Eat well and prosper,"
394,"Delicious food! Don't let the crowd outside scare you away, as it can be deceiving. Plus, even if its a long wait, it's definitely worth trying at least once.Came here around 7 pm on a weekday with a friend. There seemed to be a reasonable crowd outside of the restaurant, but we opted to stick it out and put our names down. Apparently, the crowd was deceiving, as we waited less than 5 minutes until our name was called!We sat at the bar and got hot tea to start. The hot tea here is free of charge and tasty, which is a double win in my books. For dinner, my friend got the sashimi dinner. I, on the other hand, decided to be a pig and got the pork don buri, caterpillar roll, and salmon and toro nigiri.Was it too much food? Yes, considering I wasn't even hungry. Was it still delicious? Yes. Was it worth it? Yes. The donburi was lovely and a huge portion. They did a great job of incorporating the egg into the dish-- one of the best donburi's I ever had. The salmon and toro were fresh, yummy cuts of fish and the caterpillar roll was expertly crafted. My friend's sashimi plate also looked lovely, although I obviously had too much food to even think about trying a piece.Overall, the price might be a little expensive compared to other sushi places, but its truly because you're getting far superior fish. If you want to treat yourself, eat here. Even if you are unlucky and have to wait, I think it'll be worth it."
395,"Not worth the hype unless you're getting one of their cheapo beepo specials. $50 for a nigiri sushi set that they call omakase. Yeah, that's about as omakase as calling California rolls as ""sushi""Inauthentic, bland tasteless rubbery fish. What a disappointment.My buddy got a beef teriyaki and sashimi set for $13. What a difference.."
396,"When they forget an item in the order, make sure to call back the same day. If it's after closing time (or even before), the phone will ring for a while but keep calling -- I'd call for 1 minute at a time and call back twice on your phone, so the person who mans the phone will more clearly remember not answering.I placed a $110 order Saturday night and tipped 10%. I noticed half-way through the meal that they forgot the $15.90 Tomi Special Roll. I called back at 8:07 PM but no one picked up (they close at 8 PM). I called back Sunday at lunch and they were OK with a replacement. I came back, and as I left, the two people at the front told me they normally don't do this as I'm expected to call back the same day, but they'd make an exception *this time*. I told them I did call but no one answered, and they repeated their statement: I'd have to call back the same day, but they'd make an exception *this time*.I understand that they can't have everyone coming back claiming missing food the next day and getting a free lunch; but I would have appreciated it if they responded in a different way to my statement that I did call back the same day and that no one had answered.The Tomi Special Roll was great. I shared it with my brother who also offered compliments. I've been going to this restaurant off and on for 12 years."
397,"I'm not a great fan of sushi (or any raw food items) but I try sushi once in a while..! This restaurant is located slightly away from the castro street.But noticed that it always has huge line of people waiting outside. I have  waited for almost 30 min to get seated.It was difficult for me to order, because every item has some japanese name that I could not figure out whether it was raw or cooked. I looked at the table next to me and noticed this beautiful looking sushi and decided to try it.I ordered that dish (spicy bomb -- Sushi fried and  served with spicy sauce) and loved it..!Attached the photo.Green Tea ice cream was also good."
398,"Food was pretty good, but you have to order at the right time and right environment. Often, they would leave you on the phone for about 15 minutes or more forgetting you are on hold. Often, when you call at 5:30 p.m. and order to go, and they would say they are too busy and have enough order. They open at 5:00 p.m.. Sushi Tomi food is good, but not THAT GOOD. There are other restaurants like Kakaroto, where staff is much nicer and accommodating."
399,"Came here on a weekday around 1pm to have a lunch date with the Hubby and we had a great experience.  There was no wait and we were sat right away, heard it can get pretty busy during peak hours.  The staff are really nice and attentive.  I really enjoyed their 2 piece sushi, I ordered the uni (sea urchin) and their toro (fatty tuna).  It was delicious and reasonably priced. We also ordered a 2 item bento box which had a decent selection of items.  As for their sushi rolls, they didn't have a lot of variety or weird specialty rolls, but their food is pretty fresh and delicious. Service was quick and our waitress kept checking in on us to make sure we were satisfied.  I would definitely come back to Sushi Tomi, I highly recommend this place."
400,"Catching up with a girlfriend down south after a long day of work. Sudden memory recall. I was often in this part of town in early 90s, at the time, with a boyfriend from Chicago, and we ate nothing but sushi. Terribly short lived romance but excellent meals. Girlfriend and I have known each other for nearly two decades. So happy to see her. We ordered the sashimi combo and grilled squid. Spent a lot of time catching up. Tea was quite nice. The place was exceptionally packed for a Monday evening. I could see why because the fish was quite fresh and clearly it has a following. I know nothing about the south bay any more, but for a place of meet and greet, and grab something decent to eat, and if time is no issue, this is a great place to try your patience. You'd be rewarded, clearly, because the fish is quite good, and there is no shortage of patrons waiting for your seats to allow you to appreciate your good judgment for coming here.Though, having been spoiled rotten in Japan with exceptionally good sushi, and with the handful of sushi joints that continue to wow me elsewhere in the bay area, this place's lackluster performance makes me think one thing and one thing only, there is a definite shortage of really good sushi joints in the south bay, and it's time to head back up the shore."
401,"Came here yesterday to celebrate my 46th birthday with my family.  It's been probably 13 years since we've been here and was excited to be back.  I can say that the food was pretty good and everyone in my group were happy with their orders.  The sashimi and chirashi was fresh, the sukiyaki was flavorful and sweet and the kids enjoyed their 2 combo dinner entrees. The reason for the 2 star review was this-  lack of service.  We were served by what I can describe as a rude and non-pleasant older and grumpy asian woman who came across us as treating as if we didn't know any better and this immediately made us feel unwelcomed.  We were already settled in and came early to beat the crowd so we decided to just bare and go along with it.  The tipping point started when she came out with our orders and began to set our food onto the table.  We were seated in a small table that barely accommodated our party of 5 in our group.  Still knowing this, this lady did nothing to take care when she was placing our food on the table.  She knocked over a small dish of soy sauce that spilt all over the table and nearly onto my son's lap.  She began to clean it up by grabbing a bunch of our napkins. That was fine and dandy but what pissed me off was that she offered no apology whatsoever and just walked away.  WTF?  During the entire fiasco, she pushed my chopsticks aside and in the process it had settled on the table and got dirty.  When she came back my wife had asked her for another set of chopsticks and instead of obliging, she questioned us about what happened to the set she gave me earlier.  Another WTF moment. (Look lady if I want another set of chopsticks, it is not your position to ask why.  Just give me another damn set of chopsticks. Geeze!)Anyhow, as we began to settle in, I glanced over at this same lady and found her casually speaking to another chinese-like family and she seemed to be more friendlier and opened to them in contrast to the way she spoke and treated us.  It's as if though this lady was biased or racist.  Completely different and pleasant attitude towards that group in comparison to how she was with us.  Just as always when the bill came, I offered no tip for the type of service and attitude we received and why should have I?  Tips are earned and this lady deserved Zero-nada.  I can say that this woman seemed no way Japanese at all as I know that Japanese folks are more friendlier and welcoming due to their more modest, respectable and hospitable culture. This lady was quite the opposite in all those senses. Now I question whether or not the restaurant is still Japanese owned at all.  What a way to celebrate my 46th.  Obviously in light of these circumstances and for the amount I paid ($100 +) and the poor unwelcoming service we received, we will not be coming back here ever again.  To make matters worse, I had a mild case of diarrhea about 45 min after we had left the restaurant.  We weren't even offered any complimentary tea like most sushi restaurants do.  I found that to be quite odd.I was very disappointed in what I was expecting to be a happy and joyous event that I wanted to share with my family and only was ruined by the chain of events that happened.  I felt embarrassed and it was my choice to come here since it was my birthday.  We learned our lesson and next time we'd rather go to our local neighborhood sushi restaurant at Joy Sushi where we know for sure we'd be welcomed with open arms along with a more friendlier and pleasant atmosphere and service.  I believe this grumpy elderly waitress went by the name of Paulina- Paulina- thanks for being a killjoy and ruining my special birthday dinner."
402,"Sushi Tomi is a very decent sushi place with good ambience. I had dinner at Sushi Tomi on a Friday night around 7:30pm. The place was packed and the wait was around 45 minutes. Once we got seated, service was good and efficient. I ordered the special sashimi plate and my wife ordered spicy chicken miso nabe dinner combination and tempura. Our waitress was nice enough to let us substitute the salad in the dinner combination with rice. Sashimi was especially fresh with generous cuts. The nabe was tasty with plenty of chicken and tempura was the perfect amount of crunchy, not too crunchy or soggy. The dinner combination and tempura would have been enough for dinner for two; the portions were large. The bill was about $60 with no drinks. I highly recommend this place for fresh sashimi at a reasonable price. The ambience is authentic and above what you might expect at a sushi joint. Except for the wait, Sushi Tomi is a good spot for a date night."
403,good stuff sir yes sir. pretty solid cant go wrong with anything on their menu and service is great
404,I have coming this place for 2 years..always good and fast service..good prices..clean and very friendly staff My sister also like this place for sushi
405,"Used to be a great sushi spot but now it's an average at best. In 3 orders in a row I got thin slices of sashimi that were look like leftovers. Rolls fall apart, not fresh and have fish scales. I'm done with this place."
406,The queue is always long so I enjoy with to-go. Their omakase sushi is not typical but rather unique - why I enjoy so much! and tomi special roll with Hamachi is the best!! Also themiso soup that comes with food is amazing! It's beyond regular - very dense and silky!
407,"Sushi Tomi is somewhat infamous for great Japanese food and long wait times. I would have to agree on both counts. For Japanese fare in Mountain View, you can't get fresher than this place. As yummy as it is, I still hate waiting. The solution is coming right when the restaurant opens for lunch or dinner to avoid standing outside for 45 minutes, salivating while watching people eat inside.I like coming for lunch for two reasons: 1) the wait time in general is a bit shorter, and 2) the daily lunch special is usually pretty darn special. It can be anything from a specialty sashimi plate to a Japanese curry but it has never disappointed. It also comes with their seafood miso soup, which I find delicious despite my boyfriend's complaints of fishiness. It's a bowl of miso soup loaded with various fish and seafood parts - okay, so maybe it is a little fishy, but in a good way!Dinner is a bit pricier (for the same item on the menu), typical of most restaurants. I like to sit and chat over dinner though, and this is NOT the place to do that. They expect you to eat, pay, and gtfo so they can turn the table over to the next waiting party, which I totally understand given the line outside. I will say though, service here is friendly and efficient without being overly pushy or rushed."
408,"Decided to give this place a shot based upon the fact that it is highly rated and has the most reviews of any sushi spot in Mountain View. Since we were in the city of Mountain View, we went for it. I was a bit let down. There are plenty and I mean plenty of places better than this spot for sushi/Japanese food in the bay area. First, there is a decent wait. When you're the best reviewed sushi spot  in Mountain View, you're going to get people driving in droves to visit. Their actual sushi menu is a bit on the limited side. They have the fundamentals, but in this day and age, we are above the expected. It's the unexpected that has everyone jumping for joy in the streets. Their rolls are also a bit on the smaller side. However, I can't complain for the taste. All the rolls tasted fresh, and in essence, that's pretty darn important. The service was kinda weird. They started off fast and efficient and then began to drag their feet. The food came in bursts, rather than a unified whole. My cousin had to wait 10 extra minutes for his grilled squid after we all got our food. Overall, this place is nothing special. In a region where sushi spots are all over the place, there are many better alternates."
409,"My favorite sushi place , I love when someone walks in the whole staff yell something. Great place for a date night without the kids.  The rolls were excellent . There was no wait when me and my husband went last week."
410,"Here is the 3-1-1: Food: If you are hungry and craving rolls and traditional Japanese dishes Tomi does not disappoint. The line outside before it even opens is evidence that the quality and taste are obvious. Simple flavors and combinations provide for a very satisfying meal and portions sizes are sufficient so cautious on the number of dishes ordered. Onkinmo, Sabashiyoyaki, Grilled Ika and specialty rolls are top on my list and more enough that dessert would be overload.Service: Very efficient but at times the staff is running around as the place gets full fast; if you are only there for sushi sitting at the bar is a better option. Ambiance: Simple and traditional so no frills on what the place is about but very clean, so you are there to have a great meal and not to hang out for hours on end."
411,"Wow! This place was absolutely delicious. The constant long lines explain it all. I dined here for the first time today with my coworkers during lunch and I truly enjoyed it. I can definitely tell by the quality of everything! When we arrived around 12pm there was already a line outside. I think the first wave went in already and the line outside was the second wave of ppl. I would recommend to get here around 11:30 if you don't want to wait. The service was great. Our server was quick and very attentive. I ordered the tomi bento that included 4 items for $14.90 which was an absolutely great deal. It came with tempura, teriyaki chicken, a grilled fish (I forgot the name), and sashimi(or)California Roll. It was so delicious! I think they could've done a better job on the tempura but everything was so good. I really like the sushi rice that it comes with. It also came with miso soup. I can tell this place is known for their sashimi because they didn't have many unique rolls. Just simple rolls but likely with great quality fish! Cheers!"
412,"This is one of very few sushi places in Mountain View and thus, you usually need to wait a bit to get seated. When I came here around 5:10, I got seated immediately, with 1 bar seat left. I ordered the amaebi and Tomi Special Roll with sake. The amaebi is sweet shrimp nigiri, and the order comes with 2 pieces. It also comes with 2 pieces of fried shrimp heads so you can think about getting two things for one price! The sweet shrimp is not really super fresh as it was a little slimier than the fresh ones, though it is solid. The fried shrimp heads give a nice filling appetizer before I start the Tomi Special Roll. The special roll comes with seared salmon which is nice to order along with sake (salmon) itself. It is a standard Americanized sushi roll but with relatively fresh salmon. Food is definitely a bit above average, but I honestly had better in other places; it's just that this area lacks sushi places so it is able to very easily take over the competition."
413,Really nice!Super busy but hostess was on top of itIt was well worth the driveFood was delicious!!!
414,"Solid 4.5 star sushi spot in Mountain View.  It took around 30 minutes for our group to get seated on a Friday night, but was definitely worth the wait.  My group sampled the 10-pc omakase, donkatsu, ala carte sushi and rolls, and special chirashi bowl.   All were solid and large portions, with nice cuts of fish on perfectly cooked rice.  The omakase was a bit underwhelming for the price, so I would recommend ala carte for sure.  Nice small appetizers were included as well (miso soup, fish, edamame) which was a nice touch.   Overall, a nice experience and spot I would go back to for fresh sushi and good service."
415,"Had a friend visiting for the weekend - who wanted authentic sushi .... and this is exactly what he got! Wait was around 30min but totally worth it - the warm tea outside is a nice touch to help brace the cold temperatures. Once Indoors ... service and food were fabulous . We had udon soup, sake, rainbow sushi and numerous other delicious dishes  - my favorite dish of the night was the tuna bowl. Delicious !!!"
416,"My second time here, I made a mistake in ordering the special chirashi not the ""extra"" special chirashi so uni was not included. Make sure to order the extra special chirashi as it's much better.I think the service was exceptional as well, really friendly and great!"
417,"Sushi Tomi is my absolutely favorite sushi bar in Mountain View, and maybe in the Peninsula/South Bay area. The servers are all cute little Japanese aunties and I always feel so welcomed here. Food-wise, I believe Sushi Tomi always has the freshest fish.My go-to's here: CHIRASHI: I've tried all 3 options! (Regular, special, extra special). I tend to go for the regular chirashi bowls on a normal basis. It has great chunks of salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. The special comes with scallop and fish roe. And the extra special comes with uni! All the bowls come with some very tasty tamago and pickled veggies. I tend to go for the special/extra special bowls during a special occasion or when Sushi Tomi does their anniversary celebration every September.SUSHI/SASHIMI COMBOS: My boyfriend and I pick this option when we don't know what to eat and want to try a bit of everything! Again, all the fish pieces are always super fresh. I like sitting at the sushi bar to watch the chefs prep all the rolls. All the combos come with tasty miso soup and green salad.LUNCH SPECIALS: If you drop by during the day, get the lunch special! Last time I got a small chirashi bowl. My favorite part of the lunch special is their special soup -- it's like fish broth soup with veggies and salmon. Very hearty and reminds me of something my mom would make!I haven't ordered these yet, but my friends like the ENTREE DISHES, especially the pork tonkatsu and salmon teriyaki. The portions are very big (2 dishes) plus a big side of rice!TIPS:- Try to come right before opening to make it within the first wave of eaters. Other wise you can put your name on list.- Pick table or bar seating! It's fun to watch the chefs make the sushi anyways. I typically only put table if I'm with 4 or more ppl, for ease of conversationI can't wait to come back again for a meal :P"
418,"This is one of the last places that I know of that has Japanese sushi chefs. Frankly, I don't know if that makes the sushi any better, but it sure does add to its authenticity. My wife and I have been coming here for years. The nigiri is always excellent: the fish is always well-prepared and there's never too much rice. I invariably order the hamachi kama which is the grilled collar (right behind the gills). The meat there is incredibly delicious. The normal preparation is to lightly salt it, then grill it. There is much more meat there than meets the eye. Getting that and a couple of orders of sushi are all I need."
419,"Word of Warning: If you're looking for a diabetes inducing, ooey gooey roll with an endless drizzle of kabayaki sauce, you would be better served by going to a Mizu or Kenji. However, if you're looking for a no nonsense traditional sushi restaurant where most of the staff are actually Japanese, then I suggest you give Sushi Tomi a roll.Nestled on a dark quiet side street off Castro St(which represents downtown Mountain View), the first two things you will probably notice, when arriving during dinner time, is there will inevitably be a few bodies huddled on the dark sidewalk with interesting shadows created by the light breaking through the window. Once you're seated you will notice the tightly spaced light colored wooden furniture throughout, accentuated by the bright overhead lighting.I was pleased with the Tako and Unagi(fresher than most) Nigiri, and the grilled whole squid which had a nice consistency(not over cooked) and produced a pleasant slightly smoky taste. The Sashimi dinner had thick,sizable, even cuts(even though a number of reviewers have complained about the amateur cutting they're experienced here recently).In my opinion, Sushi Tomi represents a fair value for what they serve and when I'm in the area this is still one of my favorite Sushi restaurants."
420,"While there's no shortage of sushi restaurants in the Bay Area, there certainly isn't a lot of outstanding sushi places! And this certainly is outstanding sushi! We came here on a weekday for dinner and we're surprised to see how packed the place was. We waited about half an hour to be seated. Servers are friendly and the place as a whole looks really authentic.Their hot green tea is delicious and pairs well with the sushi. Their omakase looks amazing too but we decided to get sashimi, mix don and rolls. I chose the spicy salmon roll rather than my usual spicy tuna roll upon the recommendation on the specials menu. I also got the tomi roll that had my choice of spicy tuna topped with seared scallops and tuna. Both were amazing and I was especially surprised by the spicy salmon roll! 10/10 recommend. My sister loved her mix don and came with plenty of fish on top. My parents enjoyed their sashimi as well and even bought more stuff to go! Definitely we will be back!"
421,"Love the old school feel, and you really can't beat the price for what you get. I've been here for lunch a couple of times, and luckily I haven't had to wait very long. Hard to find a place that's a quick bite that's so delicious and consistent. After reading other reviews about service, I will be honest I don't think that that's a huge concern for them, I think they are a very busy place that tries to turn tables, so of course they love to push you along to order, or make sure you're okay, but that isn't something to hold against them. Will be back.... many, many, many more times :)"
422,This is probably one of my favorite sushi restaurant in the Bay area. Amazing food and just great everything in general. I ordered omakase last Friday and it was so delicious. The dishwasher comes with three different appetizers which is really delicious and refreshing. Perfect appetizers for the summer. I also had two bottles of hot sake and it is the perfect combination with a sushi and appetizers.
423,"Amazing sushi and super fresh. I love coming here for Lunch combo. I have to say that their sushi is probably one of the best sushi I have had in the bay area. There are always long lines waiting outside and I would recommend to go there before 11:30 am for lunch and before 6 pm for dinner. I can't say enough about their food. If I have enough $, I would go there every day."
424,"This place was incredibly busy on a Tuesday night, which meant that this place had to be delicious. Unsurprisingly it was everything I was thinking. Large variety of choices. Of course, sushi is what everyone got from what I observed.I got the Sushi Dinner which was a little bit of everything. There was not one piece I did not like, all of it was tasty. Fish is fresh and really great quality. Incredible service filled with a bunch of nice people. This certainly satisfied my sushi craving."
425,"Sushi Tomi serves up top-notch sushi, and everyone knows it (evident by the constant line out the door). I am only knocking off one star because *only* their sushi is good. Their hot food items were actually really bad, and I feel like they should just take it off their menu (yeah it's that bad).My favorite items to order here are (1) futomaki, (2) nigiri sushi (extra special -- pictured), and (3) special chirashi. The fish tastes fresh with melt-in-your-mouth texture, and served at the right temperature and with sushi rice that is not too sweet, which seems to be a problem at a lot of Bay Area sushi restaurants. And the service is good, although a little abrupt. The servers are friendly and quick. As evident by my number of check-ins here, I dig Sushi Tomi. I just wish their wait times were a little shorter!"
426,We enjoyed our meal at Sushi Tomi on Thursday night. It's always nice to see outdoor seating but we opted for a both inside because it was still a little cool. The sushi menu is extensive. One can get just about any kind of sushi. We chose a fried California roll and a lobster roll. We paired it with a bottle of Pinot Grigio after a sake bomb. Dinner check came to about $75 (before gratuity)which we thought was very reasonable. The inside of the restaurant is a little dark and dingy but the food makes up for it.
427,"Fresh fresh fresh! That's all I can say... not cheap and don't expect the usual funny names rolls, that are filled with fake crab or cream cheese etc... this is the real deal... not cheap but for gosh this fresh, you get what you pay for."
428,"Food is okay. Service is mediocre, though I don't blame the servers because they seem understaffed."
429,"This small intimate restaurant does a bang up lunch service for working and shoppers. It fills fast, so we got there at 11:30 am...right when it opens.  We were surprising that a few diners were seated already.  The bento box options looked good, so that was my choice.  There were different options that one can choice ( beef, chicken, salmon, Saba, sushi...having a choice of 2, including miso soup, salad, and rice).  The food came out in a timely fashion.   I loved my Saba and salmon."
430,"Lunch bentos' prices increased by 30% to offset the 7% inflation, which is fine, but, the portion is small, even 1/2 of the original portion before the pandemic.  Like any restaurant, quality and quantity become less to recoup losses during the pandemic."
431,"Several fish specials daily, including some varieties flown in from Japan. Even on a busy night, service was efficient and we were seated after about 10-15 minutes. I highly recommend the Tomi Sushi roll; you get a choice of fish on the inside, and then the rolls are topped with salmon and scallops that are blow torched, resulting in a very nice char. The clam soup was also delicious, as was the soft shell crab, the eel bowl, and two specials that we had, consisting of sashimi and clams served sashimi style. Overall, very worth the wait and price."
432,"Quick review.Was at Tomi last night (3/9/19) and sat at the sushi bar. Had about 12 different pieces of nigiri each (wife and I) which we thoroughly enjoyed. The sushi was terrifically fresh, well prepared, and served just as you'd hope. The service was very fast, attentive, and courteous.Would recommend Tomi without question."
433,"This is the place where I normally go for sushi in the area. Everything is on point and the sushi is fresh. I usually get the combo with teriyaki salmon and sashimi. The cuts are quite generous. The uni (ordered separately) is super fresh. Just know that the wait can be quite long when going during peak hours. If you get there right when they open, then you should be fine."
434,"The hype brought me here. I've walked past this restaurant many times and didn't think much of it. It's very unassuming, whole in the wall type. However, considering all the positive reviews we gave it a try.Word is the wait can get quite long, but we came at 815PM on a Sunday evening so it was only ~15 minutes. I ordered the Extra Special Nigiri dinner and my boyfriend ordered the Combination Special: Salmon Teriyaki and Chicken Sukiyaki.His sukiyaki was good, homestyle-like; nothing fancy and prepared in the kitchen vs at our table. As part of a combination dinner, that's to be expected though. The other dishes were just ok. Boyfriend said salmon was semi-dry and my nigiri was meh. They were out of Sake which wasn't the end of the world so they substituted Hamachi per my request instead. I also got schooled by ordering the Extra Special, but didn't get Toro. Didn't realize until was too late.Bottom line: the food fell flat."
435,"Fresh fish. Good. Don't let the crowd scare you. My party of 3 was seated after a nice stroll up and down the Downtown strip. Yes, the fish is fresh and great. The sizes of the fish cuts are nice and thick which makes every piece chewy and juicy and flavourful. The wait staff appear to have had better days though, probably lacking in the enthusiasm about their food which thankfully doesn't rub off on the patrons. Our waitress failed to adequately explain the various dinner set options. What's in the sushi? Fish? Oh, you're helpful..."
436,"All time favorite place for high quality fish! During my last visit, there was surprisingly no line. Random Tuesday afternoon around 6 PM. The salmon skin roll was quite delicious, crunchy, savory, and a perfect blend with vegetable and rice. At $6, it was not as large as I'd hoped.  My favorite here is the special chirashi bowl. I personally do not care for the eel addition, but the salmon, tuna, and hamachi are by far the best and the freshest I've had in the South Bay. The combination dinner is very reasonable. It comes with a side, a main, and a miso soup as well. Overall, great value, quality meal (filling and fresh). I will be back every week!"
437,"I came here for lunch on a Wednesday night and I was impressed. Sushi Tomi is tucked into a side street of Downtown Mountain View, so it is easy to miss. But outside of the restaurant, we saw people waiting, so I knew it had to be a good place. It gets pretty crowded here, so I would recommend getting here early. We got here 30-40 minutes before closing for lunch hours, so it was perfect timing! I had the sushi set (7 pieces of nigiri sushi). It came with miso soup and it was actually a pretty big serving. I was pleasantly surprised with how fresh the sushi was and I was very satisfied after my serving. Sometimes though for some of the sushi pieces, they put a lot of wasabi tucked inside. It was SPICY, so I would recommend checking for that if you can't handle spicy foods like me. Overall, I had a great dining experience here. I loved how fresh the sushi was and how quick the service was overall. I would definitely come back if I am in the Mountain View area again."
438,"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try omakase for a while, and we saw that this place had high ratings and that it had omakase for an affordable price. We didn't have prior reservations and had to wait roughly an hour before we were sat at the bar.We decided to order 1 omakase with appetizers and 1 regular omakase. There were 3 appetizers that came out, and it was more than enough for two people. As for the omakase, I thought the fish that were chose for us was fresh! There was an ample amount of fish, and each of the plating for the appetizers and main dish were very nice. Service here was great. My waitress was friendly, and she always came by to ensure the meal was perfect."
439,"It's been years, and this review has, in a sense, been the one I wasn't proud of.  Partly, because I wanted to like this place, and now, upon reflection, the audacity of my youth.I came by on a Sunday afternoon, as the Mountain View farmers market was winding down.  I was still able to find parking right out front, which I thought was fortunate because the lot right across the street was completely full.  Guess they were shopping for greens.I dined by myself but still had to wait.  In about 8 minutes, I was seated at the bar.  I ordered the sashimi lunch special, uni, and a large hot sake.  The sashimi was standard fare, with props to the texture of the white tuna and freshness of the salmon.  The uni, which came from Santa Barbara or Maine that day as I overheard (quite the range), didn't look amazing (maybe a bit roughhoused) but tasted fine.  My main gripe was that the rice it rested upon was 1) 95% of the piece and 2) dense af.  It really detracted from the uni and threw me off, especially since the rest of the meal went was fine.  Uni that day was $15 for two pieces, which is similar to another place I dined at the week prior.  Overall, a decent place and perhaps not the terrible establishment I visited many years ago.  But then again, the circumstances were vastly different.  I doubt I'll try to visit on a busy night, but at least I can update and hopefully right some wrongs I had said in the past."
440,"Fresh from the place and not entirely happy. Maybe the staff had an off night, and for their sake I did. We walked in with maybe 2 parties ahead if us hoping to sit down in 5, maybe 10 minutes. We spot an open table for 4, somewhat confused why the otherwise packed house would leave prime real estate vacant. The table was left vacant for 30 minutes before we were sat at the table. Why? I cannot possibly hope to understand. Not a good start.The waitress asks for our drink order: tea and water being the usual fare, and drops off a tea pot and a single cup of water. 2 short. 2nd request for more water. Nothing. 3rd request. Still lacking water. 4th times the charm 10 minutes since getting the teapot.We order: 2 sashimi dinners, 1 sushi dinner, order of squid, and chicken wings (the menu also doesn't tell you what you get with your order. Just the order, a Japanese translation, and the price). 4 minutes in, the two sashimi dinners come out (pretty quick. The place may redeem itself). 12 pieces for the price is a bit high ($21) but no complaints about the fish. 10 minutes pass and we stare down a waitress.  Bewildered at why so unhappy, she asks if everything is ok. Still missing an entree and two sides. I would've taken the fish and bowl of rice and made the sushi myself at this point. Assembly can't be that bad right?  Another waitress comes by and informs us that a lot of people are ordering the sushi dinner and it got backed up. Really?6-7 minutes pass and the sushi dinner comes out. For the same price as the sashimi dinner, it is down right shameful what they give you: 12 pieces of something that might pass as sushi, 3 of which are California rolls. I'll use caps for emphasis: CALIFORNIA ROLLS. With imitation crab they must've bought at Safeway. Another piece posing as sushi, (masago) was rice wrapped in seaweed with a scant bit of fish eggs on top. So that's 8 pieces of fish and 4 pieces of trash for $21. Bravo. The fish was disturbingly warm and must've been one hell of a swimmer or old since the fascia was abnormally tough, making the fish chewy and not the most pleasant experience.The wings were decent (fried chicken wings. Not the hardest things to prepare) and the squid came topped with a healthy serving of fermented chopped soy beans which smelled like garbage. They waitress comp'd us some green tea ice cream that was rock solid (as in texture and hardness, not amazing tasting) but there was no redeeming this place. In short, save your money. Downtown MV has better places to go."
441,"The first time I went here was with a group for lunch and it was great!  But this second time was ok.  I ordered the lunch combination with two choices of entrees and chose saba shioyaki (grilled mackerel) and tempura, which comes with salad, miso soup, rice and a couple of orange wedges.  The tempura was greasy and the saba was also on the greasy side.  I went a neighboring Japanese restaurant the week before and their saba and tempura was not greasy at all.  I will have to say their nigiri sushi is excellent.  Got the hamachi and sake.Their service is good but it seems they want to get you in and out since they are a small place and there's always a wait. So you definitely need to get there early to get a table.  Also take note:  Your whole party must be there before getting seated, even if you have four people."
442,Still the best sushi I've ever had in the Bay Area! They don't take reservations but it's worth the wait. There is always a line out the door and for good reason! The service is always fast and responsive. A great family owned business.
443,"Loud, crying babies (plural!) in stereo in a tiny dining room made me want to cry, too. Wah! I have to listen to crying babies because I already put in my order! Uwaaagh! Anyway, not their fault and not the reason for the 2.A line had formed outside 10 minutes before opening but some tables were already seated. Had barely just gotten our drinks when they asked if we were ready to order. When asked for a minute, they took us literally and came back 60 seconds later.The douchebag who had the balls to *complain* the omakase came with ""exotic"" things such as squid (hahahahahaha) said waitstaff was Chinese and not Japanese, could he really tell? Our waitress wore a nametag with a Japanese name (Asami) and had a Japanese accent. Many patrons were Chinese, based on the conversations around me. (So if you're one of those white people who thinks this place must be legit because all the clientele are Japanese... I have news for you, lol.)Open letter to said douchebag: if you are picky, what are you doing getting omakase in the first place? It doesn't even save you any money. And then complaining you didn't get what you wanted?! It's omakase, aka literally ""leave it up to [the chef]."" It's not the servers fault you live under a rock and don't know abalone exists in sushi bars.The food was so blah we went elsewhere afterwards. The consensus was that it was not worth the wait or the uncomfortably cramped dining room and the blown-out eardrums (without there even being music).Iced green tea is only a dollar per person and unsweetened. A good deal but tasted like roasted tea and not matcha desite looking like there was matcha powder in it.They put wasabi on the nigiri automatically. Have to ask for no wasabi if you don't like it, or like me, only like the real stuff, not the green paste. A Yelper said it was real wasabi but obviously doesn't know what real fresh-grated wasabi is.The spicy tuna is really spicy. They're also sloppy Americanized inside-out rolls.The nigiri was not great. The tuna was the worst, sad and pale and bland. The salmon was okay, not great. The yellowtail was strongly fishy.Supposedly they fly their fish in from the Tsukiji market in Japan, but if they do, maybe it sits in customs or is frozen or are the cheapest off-cuts nobody in Japan wanted, because it's nothing special.I felt bad holding up the line just finishing my tea so I asked for a to-go cup. Waiter named Tea (he sounded like he might be Chinese, so maybe the douchebag customer did get a Chinese server but the ethnicity of the waitstaff has no bearing on whether you should tip because you didn't like what was in the omakase you had no business ordering) said they didn't have drink cups but they did have soup containers. After requesting one of those, he brought it but made a big deal about it as if I guess to warn us away from doing it again which left a bad taste in my mouth.i could have sat there for 30 minutes taking up their table. I was only askinv for it to go so they could seat new people and make more money. If they'd rather have slower turnover over a 25 cent soup container, that's fine with me, but don't offer me something you don't want to give me and then get annoyed when I accept.I don't know why it's so hard to get high-quality sushi in the Bay area. I miss when Geta didn't suck. I guess I have to stuff myself at Sushi Gen every time I go home to LA and let it keep me until the next time I go home. Wish I could store sushi in a hump like a camel."
444,"Not bad food. Only complaint is when you otdr a chirashi, or a tekka don. They don't separate the hot sushi rice from the fish. I don't like eating warm/hot raw fish!"
445,Sushi tomi definitely the right choice for great sushi the staff wearing masks and keeping social distance 5 stars indeed
446,"One of the vest sushi place in South Bay - I would tie it with Amami Shima Sushi in Cupertino.Very fresh ingredients with reasonable price. Of course you want be there earlier or you will have to wait in the line, but the line is not insane."
447,My favorite sushi place great menu I like the miso soup and hamchi very fresh and clean
448,"Sushi Tomi is one of my favorite restaurants in the Mountain View area because the food is good and the prices are wallet-friendly to boot.Our favorites -- The sushi & sashimi are fresh and tasty.  The chicken sukiyaki (a savory-yet-slightly-sweet noodle soup with chicken & vegetables) is delicious as well.Usually there is a wait for dinner on the weekends.  Don't come hungry, or else you'll be super hangry and drive your dining companions crazy.One thing that's kind of sketch... there is usually a small bowl of gummy bears near the front door.  While I love gummy bears, it makes you wonder how many little kids have stuck their hands in that bowl & contaminated the gummy bears with un-nameable germs.  Just don't touch the candy bowl & you will be fine, though."
449,"soooo my cousin, Jennifer Y. is completely addicted to this place. She raves about this PLACE ALL THE TIME. so of course one of the days my other cousin from canada flew in, we had to try this place out. We came after work so around 830, the wait was about 15-20 min AND THEY RAN OUT OF SALMONNN  ): ): The restaurant is an average size, but it looks small and crowded bc the tables are kinda close together to they try and fit more people. We were helped right away with tea and water. We ordered a few rolls and 1-2 huge plates of sashimi. Everything was super good! I remember we got the sushi tomi roll, which was delicious. The fatty tuna (toro) was to DIE FORRR!!! omgg it was sooo buttery and just melted in my mouth. Really made me appreciate the different kinds of sashimi more. They also had UNI!! It was my first time trying and we were given a small portion on our sashimi plate. Kinda smushy but i liked it! My cousin didnt because the piece he got still had a slight distinct fishy taste/smell to it. Overall, although they ran out of salmon, the sushi and sashimi we got were still really good. The waitstaff accommodated to our needs and was nice and helpful. I can see why customers keep coming back to eat!"
450,"Came here on a Friday for dinner. It was PACKED! There isn't much room to wait inside so we ended up waiting outside for around 20 minutes for 2 people.I got the special chirashi bowl ($25). There are options for the chirashi bowl (regular, special, extra special). The sashimi was sooooooo delicious. It tasted very fresh and high quality and everything was really good! Each piece was large and generous.My boyfriend got the bento box with beef teriyaki. I thought that the beef teriyaki was quite tough and chewy, but he enjoyed it.My only complaint would be that it's really pricey for the amount of food you get, but I'm sure you're paying for the quality. I don't think I'd come here regularly, but if I were really craving good Japanese food, I would definitely come. Overall, it's a really good Japanese place!!!"
451,"Everything is good here: the miso, the salad, the sashimi, the sushi, the tempura, the saba... would come back and try other things."
452,"Super cozy sushi restaurant, my favorite casual sushi in the South Bay Area. Lunch specials and combos are great, the fish here is fresh and tasty. My favorite thing to get here is the Tomi Special Roll. Loaded with salmon and torched so there's that smokey flavor, topped with some sauce and red onions. This is the perfect roll evarrr."
453,Great sushi set menu. The nigiri is beautiful and warming miso soup is ideal. They're always very busy but it is worth taking the time to visit
454,"I've been meaning to go here for some time and finally had the chance. Everything there is freshly made! I ordered too much, but even as leftover takeout, it was still good! I had salmon, sweet egg, and tuna nigiri; chicken teriyaki combo with potstickers, miso soup, salad, and rice, and special sushi roll with spicy tuna. The chicken teriyaki was juicy and had the right amount of sauce to go with it. All the nigiri were fresh and satisfying. Their special sushi roll... a must-have!! I loved it to the end. Bonus for giving us orange slices! Service was the usual, but I am happy that they provided us a sushi menu with a pencil to write down our order. Forewarning: this place is small and has no waiting lounge or seats. Best to make reservations or else, stand out in the cold for about 30+ minutes, even for a table for two."
455,"We were craving Japanese food and where else do we go? Ordered via phone and came to pick up food. The staff where all in masks, gloves and hair nets during COVID19 lockdown."
456,"Love the fish here!!Every time we've come, there's been a crazy long wait, but it's well worth it!!It feels super cramped inside, you can hear your neighbors conversations, which is kind of a downer for me..  and they charge for fresh wasabi... So -1 star for that :(Servers don't come around much, which I attribute to how busy it always is.The fish here is incredibly fresh and I've enjoyed every single piece of sashimi and nigiri we've had here. Toro, sake, sake toro, tai, hamachi, hamachi toro, literally everything is good. We're not big roll eaters, but we did try one that was deep fried, and it was pretty good, actually!"
457,Just overpriced Japanese food.  Late lunch so no wait but the food was bland and the waitress were pushy.  My only positive feedback is that they served nice hot green teas.
458,"Sushi Tomi? More like Sushi Tummy. As in, ""get in my tummy, now!"".I ordered the lunch combo ($10.90) which comes with two choices of entree items, salad, rice and miso soup. I opted for teriyaki chicken and teriyaki salmon. The chicken was crispy (mainly due to the skin being left on) and the salmon was flavorful. The sweet teriyaki sauce was quite enjoyable. And bonus points for the hearty miso soup, which came with small tofu cubes and green onion.The wife ordered the daily special (also $10.90) which was the chirashi bowl with salmon and tuna. The sushi: very fresh. Me: very envious.We also splurged for an order of salmon avocado rolls and California rolls; each was $6.90 for six pieces, and each was fantastic. I really think we needed at least two more orders of these...The waitstaff was genuinely friendly with good service to boot. The only bad thing about this place is the long line outside!"
459,"We came here on a Saturday evening around 6:30pm and ended up waiting about 1.5 hours before getting in. It's a pretty small place, so be prepared to wait for a while.We ordered the special chirashi, the tomi roll with spicy tuna, salmon toro nigiri, and the katsu don. The special chirashi was really pretty and included a wide assortment of fish and accompaniments. The sashimi here is really fresh, and the salmon was very soft and delicious. The tomi roll was really good as well. The katsu don was pretty bland, so I wouldn't recommend it. The salmon toro was what made our meal though. I've actually never seen salmon toro at a sushi place, and now I wish every restaurant offered it. The salmon was so buttery and melt-in-your-mouth! I'd come back just for the salmon toro."
460,"this place is overrated, maybe its above average sushi place in San Jose, but overall, it was an very disappointment experience.We had Chirashi bowl, Pork don, beef tongue and house sake.First of all, the house sake taste like pure alcohol....so...The Chirashi bowl was standard, but nothing surprise, the fresh level is standard as well.the beef tongue is really hard and rubbery !!! do not get their beef tonguePork don's pork is too chewy.i rarely eat bad pork don."
461,So fresh and worth the wait. The only reason I gave it four stars is because there is a very long wait. As soon as it opens it is completely full. People wait outside in a line before they even open their doors. You'd be lucky if you came with no long line. Don't give up keep trying wait in line and eat here. The sushi is very fresh.
462,"Review during Covid pandemic take out only - the sushi itself was quite good.1 star off for poor service. I arrived early and my order wasn't ready yet. I informed them I'm waiting in my car on the curb just right outside the restaurant and I pointed to my car. I waited and waited and waited. I didn't want to pester them but After 45 min, I went to counter again and they pretended to not know. My order was the only one left. Even if they didn't know, why wouldn't they call me?"
463,"I had heard great things about Sushi Tomi, so I decided to give it a shot for date night. We ordered the Tomi Special Roll, Special Sashimi, and Special Chirashi. We over ordered, but that's another story. Anyways, the Tomi Special Roll was really good. Fish was fresh and generous. I really liked the sauce. It was like a Sriracha mayo or Chipotle kind of sauce. I'd say the Tomi Special Roll is one of the better rolls I've had.The Special Sashimi was really good. The toro was delicious and melted in your mouth. The pieces were pretty generous. The Special Chirashi was alright. The fish was fresh but I wasn't a fan of the variety. I think the Tomi Special Roll and Special Sashimi would've been enough."
464,"Super fresh fish - the omakase sushi comes with 10 different pieces of nigiri. If they have uni, get the extra special chirashi. Otherwise, the special chirashi is great as well. Check their specials whiteboard when you enter to see what's fresh - but you have to come early to get this! Otherwise, they tend to run out of the special fish of the day when you come later. They even have fish from Tsukiji Fish Market sometimes!! This place can get packed and parking can be hard to find due to its location in downtown Mountain View."
465,Oldie and a goodie. This is has been our default sushi location in the SF Bay Area and has always been deliciously consistent. A typical order is either the extra special chirashi (if I'm feeling lazy) or the extra special sashimi set. Add a couple of a la carte items and it's a fun meal.
466,"I can see why Sushi Tomi is a popular place. I enjoyed the sashimi selection which was reasonably priced at $33.  I can find no fault in the freshness of their fish, however, I did find a bone in my salmon!  Chef? please double check next time, nothing turns me off than having to stop chewing midway so I don't stab the roof of my mouth with fish bone.Don't skip the appetizers, it showcases a variety of grilled items which are perfect for sharing! The chicken skin is so good with just the right amount of crispness and the charcoal markings are so tasty.  I'd skip the beef tongue, it is tough and chewy -- I've had better tongue elsewhere (TWSS?) I wouldn't categorize Sushi Tomi as a destination resto, but definitely worth a try if you're in the neighborhood."
467,"I will be very short: my wife and I pulled several long hair from the dish we ordered that we even did not complained, just left, knowing we will never be back. The line outsie was huge. I always look at Sushi places run by Japanese chef. It is run by old Chinese couple with all Hispanic staff. So you can imagine what kind of Japanese guys they serve."
468,Sushi tomi it's a great place very clean and fresh great ingredients with amazi g crew definitely 5 stars indeed
469,"I've eaten their sushi a couple of times and it  is a bit on the pricy side comparing to other sushi restaurant in the area. However, the sushi here is not bad. Overall I had an okay experience."
470,"One of the most surprisingly good sushi places I've beenWho'd knew there would be such a great sushi place in the suburbs? No wonder this place is packed, with a huge line outside.On the surface, the sushi looks just like that of any other above-average sushi shop--colorful and fresh, which is already a good sign. It's when you actually bite into the sushi that you realize that this place is one-level-above the usual good sushi shops!The california roll is awesome--I've always thought of california rolls as a non-authentic sushi, but this place somehow made me change my mind! The combination of real crab meat, and the oooz of paste-y flavor that gets realized when you bite into the roll is crazy good. I did not know what's how california rolls were meant to taste like.Get the Tomi Special roll. It not only looks great when served, with fancy plating, but tastes extremely fresh. The roll is well-packed, so that it doesn't fall apart when you hold it with chopsticks, and there are large chunks of sashimi flesh both inside and outside the roll. Pretty unreal.The chirashi was also very well prepared--the arrangement of the sashimi on top is pretty much the same as what I saw in the other yelp photos, so it looks like they are consistent about serving high-quality food with a consistently great attention to detail.Would definitely come back (probably during non-rush-hours)!"
471,"Tomi Sushi has been one of the leading spot for diners to go and fulfil their craving for major Japanese food. Simple, amazing quality and yet decently priced food, sounds like a winner! The restaurant itself was very quite petite, but it was decorated in a traditional way - quite lovely and homey. We came in on Saturday evening and it was really packed, waited about 45 mins, which seems like a long time since they don't have a waiting area and on top of that we were starving :PI ordered their Sake Don - thick cut of salmon belly on top of the sushi rice bed. The dish arrives in a cute bento box, preparation was beautiful. I love how fresh the fish was, but weird as it sounds... I enjoyed the sushi rice more than anything, it was perfectly seasoned, sweet and vinegary. In conclusion, for me, Tomi Sushi is a simple Japanese restaurant serving quite enjoyable food with relatively quite friendly price tag. Would definitely be back!"
472,Good quality sushi for the price. Great lunch deals!
473,"I had the Tomi bento box. It had chicken teriyaki, some piece of fish, sashimi and tempura.The fish was ok until I had bones. My chicken teriyaki needed more sauce. The sashimi was ok, tempura was greasy.Service was ok. I was seated within a reasonable waiting time."
474,"I wanted to like Sushi Tomi so much but the price was way too high to appreciate its value. Usually the cost of chirashi doesn't bother me but when almost all of the main menu items starts off at $20 and with some hunger left, my experience fell flat.To make the most out of $20, order the dinner entree combination. My friend picked the sashimi and tempura combo, and received 8 pieces of sashimi. Meanwhile, my boyfriend's mom who paid even more for the regular chirashi bowl, had 9 pieces of sashimi. Some may argue for the variety in the chirashi bowl, but it didn't feel worth it to have the 1 extra item in the end. The special chirashi bowl ($21.99) that my boyfriend and I shared had a little more to offer, but nothing about it felt special. The katsu donburi was delicious and I ate all of the meat. The 6-piece  spicy tuna roll was very ugly looking and had a ton of rice.Maybe because of the price, the lovely pictures, and the one-thousand something glowing Yelp reviews, we wanted to justify our experience here being fantastic. But with our bill coming up to $100 with a bit of hunger left and, somehow, too much rice still left over, I still felt 'regular' afterwards."
475,"Came to Sushi Tomi and was not disappointed. The miso soup was standard and I ordered the Sushi Lunch (5 pc nigiri and 3pc California roll, 3pc tuna roll, and 3 pc cucumber roll). I think for the price I paid it was a good value. The crab stick inside the California rolls were generous and really flavorful. Tuna and cucumber rolls were really there to make sure you didn't leave hungry. In my nigiri I believe I had tuna, snapper, salmon, hamachi, and shrimp. (I might be wrong on the snapper/hamachi)The nigiri was good and the slices of fish were cut generously. We were served green tea and left feeling very satisfied. The ambiance is great and you get a pretty authentic feel in the restaurant; if you're alone or with one other person I'd definitely recommend grabbing a seat in front of the sushi chefs to watch them make it!"
476,"Ordered a bunch of nigiri (and a super bomb roll) for takeout, and it was ready perfectly on time.The quality and freshness of the fish here is AMAZING. Make sure to look at the sign out front for the fresh fishes of the day!The toro, unagi, and hamachi honestly may have been the best I've had. I can't speak to the other dishes here, but if you get the chance, definitely stop by for their sushi!"
477,"The best sushi restaurant in Santa Clara county, period!It's not cheap but it's worth it! This is the only restaurant where I don't look at the price.Caution: My review is only focused  on sushis and rolls because I only order these items when I go there.The only negative point is it's so good that it's hard for me to try another sushi place because I'm always disapointed."
478,My sushi lunch today was disgusting. The hamachi and tuna were not fresh at all. Not to mention it is totally over price with such low quality and health hazardous food. I was with my coworkers and I didn't want to make a scene out of it. I will not recommend this restaurant to anybody. Please See my pictures attached!
479,"Still one of my favorite sushi/Japanese spots! Lunch wasn't too crowded (compared to dinner - usually have to get here at least fifteen to twenty minutes before opening or else you'll wait up to an hour), but I did get there right after it opened. Seated at the sushi bar and was served quickly. Great portion size for the lunch combo (two entrees, miso soup, salad, rice). I got sashimi and tempura. Sashimi - 5 pieces, fresh as always but was irregularly cut (not a big deal to me). Tempura - 1 shrimp and some veggies - lightly fried and not too oily, good variety. I've also enjoyed the teriyaki salmon and their saba in the past."
480,"This is my favorite sushi place. Affordable price yet high quality. The fish melt in your mouth. Go early, since it's usually packed, but the wait isn't too long."
481,"They have some fresh fish!Came in for lunch on Saturday and waited 20-30 minutes for a table. They have daily specials but, it's listed on a small chalkboard and very easy to miss.Spider roll comes with tobiko - $12 for 4 piecesCombo lunch with chicken teriyaki, 3 pieces of salmon, 2 tuna, miso soup - $12, a great dealThe ama ebi, salmon, tuna, and yellowtail nigiri were all very fresh.Would recommend but the raw fish is slightly pricey, this lunch came out to around $120."
482,"Always nice coming back to Tomi Sushi. We ordered mostly from Today's Special. Fresh sashimi $20, fresh scallops and clams, fresh hamachi kama grill, beef bento with gyoza. Also got the colimentary poke salad with seaweed on top. Ordered tempura udon for my kids as well. Requested to separate the noodle and broth, so it wont get bloated as my kids eat pretty slow. However the waitress got complained since it's not the japanese way to do it. Well, customer pay the bill, so customer always wins!"
483,"I had lunch here with a friend on a Friday at 12:45 and even though there were a few people ahead of us, the wait wasn't long at all! It was about 10-15 minutes at the most. We shared a lunch bento with beef teriyaki and sashimi. The sashimi came with salmon and tuna and it were delicious! I noticed that they gave us salmon toro! :) The beef teriyaki was a little dry and chewy, but the flavoring was pretty good. We also ordered some nigiri: salmon, hamachi belly, unagi, hotate, and uni. The top layer on the uni was firm and very fresh, but when I looked under at the second layer, it was a different texture and color - less bright/firm. The contrast between the two types of uni was strange, but it still tasted okay. The hamachi belly melted in my mouth (yum!!), but one of them had a pretty big bone in it. Regardless, the fish was extremely fresh and they didn't skimp on the size of it. I love it when sushi restaurants let you choose if you want the belly (toro) of the fish! This restaurant definitely lets you choose to have salmon toro or hamachi toro, with an additional price, of course. Parking is a little tough but not too bad. Customer service is outstanding- everyone is polite and attends to you if you need anything! :) I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant and definitely will be back if I'm in the area!For 2 people including tax, it came out to ~$70."
484,"Don't ever let the long lines discourage you for waiting it out, one of the best sushi places in the Bay Area. They don't have a bunch of rolls but the charashi bowls, bento boxes, udon and the rolls they have on their menu are delicious!The Tomi roll with hamachi is my go to! They give good portions for the bento boxes. Service is always very prompt and servers are very nice. I always come back here because I know the food is always fresh!"
485,"Great Japanese operated sushi restaurant serving traditional high quality food. Don't expect to find ""crazy rolls"" here with cream cheese and stuff that doesn't belong inside sushi. They have great nigiri and sashimi, the original selections. I really like their chirashi here (sashimi over a bed of sushi rice)."
486,This spot serving great sushi I've tried tomi sushi place and I always enjoying the vibes and they sushi highly recommend
487,"Some of the best sushi in the area! Really fresh and always delicious. Fair prices. You should call ahead to place your order, and expect a short wait in line on weekends to pick up. Definitely worth it, always convenient, and friendly staff. It has never disappointed! Really highly recommended."
488,"High quality sushi.  This has become our ""go to"" sushi restaurant. There are also some interesting, authentic options and specials available. I was excited to try something new.  I wish they would use a part of the parking lot across the street for outdoor dining but understand that crossing a road to serve patrons does present some safety concerns."
489,"I love this place, favorite sushi in the South Bay, hands down. Such a nondescript location and frontage, but lines will always be crazy. Just shows how much people like it. It's a bit pricey, but I always opt for the ""Extra Special Nigiri Set""--simple name, but it works for me. There are a surprising number of seats in the restaurant, but it's always packed. The sushi is the freshest I've found in the area, with each piece just melting in your mouth. There is the perfect amount of wasabi on each piece, with not too much sushi rice either. Overall, one of my favorites. Recommendations: extra special nigiri setPros: Food, service, enough parking around Okays: A bit removed from Castro streetCons: Wait can get a bit long"
490,"I decided to try Sushi Tomi based on a friend's recommendation for good Japanese food in the area. After a 30 min wait, we were seated and ordered food. I ordered the Special Chirashi Bowl ($25) and thought it was okay (a bit small, fish was cut weirdly and didn't taste very fresh) and definitely overpriced. My friend had the Beef Teriyaki ($16?) and he said it was pretty good. I'm leaving the review at 3* from my personal experience but maybe the non-sushi meals are higher quality and better value."
491,"Sushi Tomi is one of the better sushi spots in the South Bay. And it's one of the few places in downtown MTV that's open late on most nights. Their assorted chef's choice, is enough to feed 2 and will only run you ~$25 total. Parking is typically available in the small lot across the street."
492,Great bentos and fresh sushi. I'm a regular for both lunch and dinner. If they have kama on their daily specials menu I will always order it. Open during shelter in place. Order by phone. They have their regular menu items as well as daily specials. Call for daily specials. The website shows specials for the SJ location. As a FYI ...Sushi Tomi = Mountain View location (off Castro).  Tomisushi = San Jose Moorpark (near Mitsuwa) location.
493,"This place is amazing! What a find in Mountain View, only 2 miles away from my work! This restaurant is a perfect neighborhood gem with amazing sushi. I got the ""Mix Don"" which had tuna, salmon, and hamachi. They give you 3 large slabs of fish each, so 9 great big pieces, all over sushi rice. My sushi don just looked so happy when it arrived too. The quality of the fish was great too.Service was very prompt - I really appreciated this since I was in a rush for lunch. I came at the later side, like 1:30pm (they close at 2), ordered within 5 mins, my food came within 5 mins, and I was out the door by 1:55pm. So awesome. They were not rushing other customers who were there with company though. The service in general was very hospitable! They were all so sweet, made me feel welcome, spoke wonderful English (I guess this is where SF differs from MTV) and smiled. Can't wait to return! I love this spot! I need to return after a hard day of work!"
494,"Sushi Tomi has been one of our favorites when we want to treat ourselves to authentic Japanese. They are open and doing take out for covid-19, but can be busy especially for dinner and on the weekends. The fish is fresh and you get good portions. Though they are on the pricey side it is worth every penny! We have always had a great experience here with the service and the food even before Covid, and will continue to come back for their delicious sushi."
495,I only came here because it was around the corner from a morning appointment. We got there right when it opened and there were people lined up already.I got the chirashi bowl. It was average and nothing amazing.I'm not from the area and this is definitely not a place I would wait in line for. Most likely would not return.
496,"Glad they are serving take out during the lock down period.  Good sushi at reasonable prices. Friendly staff, nice atmosphere."
497,"Hands down best pure sushi in Mountain View. They get the rice right and the cuts are great. This is for sushi lovers, Not mass quantity roll lovers. I also love their non sushi items, especially the octopus appetizer and hamachi kama. They are always busy during normal meal times so be prepared to get there early and wait or just get there and wait.Occasionally I get to go for no weight as well just call it inYou just can't go wrong here Tomi sushi Rocks"
498,"This and the location on Saratoga are my favorite sushi spots in the bay area. Been to quite a few sushi spots in SF that weren't as good and twice as expensive. I love their lunch specials and omakase. Everything is fresh and you know it's authentic when all the employees are Japanese ... not Korean, haha. None of those froofy rolls with subpar fish drenched in sauce to hide the fishiness."
499,"LOVED this place. The wait it wild though -- I got there at 5:40pm (10 minutes after it opened) on a Monday night, and I got the last table. When I left around 6:45, there was a line of at least 15 people waiting!PROS:* sake sashimi was SOO fresh + thick cuts* got the tempura udon, extremely tasty/good balance of the broth not being overpowering with the tempura. big portions* lots of menu options* extremely friendly serversCONS:* fills up very quickly, they don't take reservationsOVERALL:I'm just visiting Mountain View, but if I lived around here, I'd definitely make it a classic treat-yo-self spot (maybe order take-out over the phone)!"
500,"Sushi Tomi is my family's usual fare when/if we are craving Japanese food. However last few visits, we've been very disappointed. We went last Sunday night 10min after they opened. We were seated at the last table for the opening crowd. Soon after the line started forming outside with quite a sizable crowd. We ordered our usual menu and all was good until the rolls came out. We had the spider roll and eel roll and they looked like they were clumps of rice mixed with other ingredients. Not only did they look nothing like rolls, they were so loosely wrapped, it all fell apart when I picked it up with chopsticks. Ok, maybe they're training an apprentice. I can overlook that since it tasted fine. However, the reason for the 2 stars is because of the horrible way we were rushed out of the restaurant. All throughout the meal, the waitstaff kept coming by almost every 3-5 min to ask if we needed anything else. Only to us! I know attentive service but this was borderline obnoxious and invasive. It may have been that we're an Asian family with 2 young teens (culturally Asians eat fast meals). Not couples on a date or a table full of adults conversing. We finally asked for our check and the man who brought it actually admitted that they have so many people waiting outside that they need our table. We were the last to get seated around us and the first to get booted. We got there at 5:10 and left at 5:40. It takes us longer to eat at In N Out. Horribly disappointed  with their service!"
501,"Solid sushi place on Castro. I came at 7pm on Saturday for dinner and waited about 15 minutes for a table for two. I ordered the sashimi dinner, which wasn't super filling, but tasted great nonetheless. Overall, this place is on the pricier side, but it's a solid place to get sushi if you find yourself on Castro"
502,"This is the best sushi place in the neighborhood.  The quality of fish is fresh and tasty.  We always go there for dinner during week night.  The place gets very crowded around dinner time and weekends.  We often see long line outside the restaurant.I usually order nigiri sushi like salmon, hamachi, Uni, and Tomi roll.  They are delicious.  Quality is consistent.  Service is good and fast."
503,"I was spending one night in Palo Alto so I decided to go to a restaurant within a short walking distance from my hotel.  Sushi Tomi was it.  I would say it was a decent restaurant.  The food tasted good but nothing was spectacular.  If I decide to stay at the same hotel, I will probably walk here again but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.  I had the bento box which came with three entree choices, rice, miso soup, and salad.  The food was good and filling."
504,This place is always super busy. Not sure why. The food is good but not amazing. However I'm not a huge sushi conossieur so maybe I'm not the best person to review. Staff is pretty on top of things which is nice. Prices are reasonable especially for the area. If someone is visiting and wants to go for sushi this is my go to because I assume the fact that there is always a line means the masses have agreed that the quality is good. Recommend getting there early and avoid at lunchtime because you will be waiting a while.
505,"This is - bar none - the best sushi restaurant I have found. Reasonable prices, outstanding fish quality, they really know how to pick their fish. It's out of this world. If you're a fan of eel, try their anago! It tastes like all the best parts of the ocean. The only downside is the huge line that often forms before they even open!"
506,"I am a loyal fan of this place.  I come here at least once a month so why did I not give it a 5 stars???For the more fine type of fish and cut such as Toro, it doesn't melt in my mouth like how Sushi Sam does it!!!  The sushi rice is also not quite at the elite level (vinegar balance ... etc).   I fully enjoy more their comfort food such as a Bento Box.  Now +1 star cause they give us thick slices of Sashimi!  Is that the right practice in Japan?  Nooo but I am absolutely OK with it!"
507,A small and cozy place but boy! the quality of the food is worth every bit of eves dropping one has to endure.
508,Sushi Tomi is the best sushi in Silicon Valley. They just celebrated their 24th year and are family owned and operated. You cannot go wrong with their omakase and fresh wasabi. It's location is ideal to walk around downtown MTV.
509,"An overrated place! Salmon sashimi / sushi is ok (fresh as you can get in any Japanese groceries in San Mateo), but the yellow tail is old and they didn't even bother to take its skin off...."
510,"I've came here many many times.  I had great experience and loved this place. But on this Tuesday, I was a bit disappointed. I came with my sister and ordered some nigiri:SalmonHamachiUniToroBluefin tuna AbaloneHamachi Mackerel Spanish mackerel AmaebiScallop For some reason, I was not impressed with the raw fish. They weren't that fresh/flavorful. Can't really tell what I'm eating. The amaebi didn't have that sweet taste to it. The only standout is the toro. Also too much sushi rice on each piece of fish... maybe that's why the fish don't taste as tasty. The 4 stars are for the other times I came in here. But for today's sushi, I'll give it a 2.5-3 stars."
511,"Great service, fresh fish... Wonderful all around.I was craving UNI and called Sushi Tomi to see if they had any. Whoever I spoke to said they did and to come by! Gladly I did, but when I preceded to order my generous helping of sea urchin, our sweet waitress told us they did not have any at all! I was heartbroken and even explained to our waitress that I called in advance to double check. She felt so awful and gave my family and I free miso soups and salads. Halfway into our meal, the sweet waitress told us plenty UNIII had just arrived to the restaurant. I was thrilled and so was our waitress! She was so sweet, I would recommend this place to anyone, not just for the fresh sashimi but also for the excellent service!"
512,"Classic ""Silicon Valley"" establishment where you're paying more than you should while getting poor mistreated piles of frozen fish blocks. Don't take my word, just go take a look at the sushi bar for yourself while you're standing around during that 30-60 min wait. Besides the terrible food poisoning, I was seated next to a couple of loud neighbors bragging about their lives in ""Silicon Valley,"" which kinda made me want to puke more. I gave 2 stars because if you add a filter, you'll still be able to post the food on Instagram. But deep down in your heart, you'll know it came out of that dirty kitchen. Again...plenty of time to take a look while you're standing in line."
513,"Ok, after that hypes from various yelpers and friends I decided to check out Sushi Tomi. First, I went on a Sunday night around 8 PM and I saw a line outside the restaurant. I chickened out and decided to dine elsewhere.Last night, I felt like some fresh fish (chirashi!!!) and decided to come here. It was almost 9PM when I got there and the restaurant was closing in 30 minutes. I got seated at the bar (no wait), it was fine but I'm not even 5 ft tall so sitting on a high bar stool was not very comfortable. Especially, the bar seating was kinda tight....Anyway... I ordered their ""regular"" (cheapest) Chirashi and Beef Tongue skewers. They gave me a complimentary bowl of miso soup (it looks like it comes with the chirashi as the man sitting next to me got it too) but I didn't get a bowl of free edamame. The man next to me has it and some reviewers mentioned about it too... so that was a bit weird...because I never would pass on free stuff especially edamame.. love that stuff!!The beef tongue came out pretty quickly. I got 3 skewers (the waitress said 2 when I inquired about the quantity when I placed my order), but guessing that because one of the skewer was a bit thinner..so maybe they comp me with an extra one. The tongue was lightly seasoned, pretty good... tasted like beef tongue...Now... my chirashi was sitting on the counter for quite sometimes...(yes, I was religiously eye-ing on it and I knew that was MINE!!!). The waitresses seemed to have problems in efficiency. There were quite a good amount of ready-to-served food on the counter..just waiting for the waitresses to pick them up. They kept going to the counter, spoke to the chef, spoke to each other and discussed about who knows what and ignored the food. Finally, one of chef (realizing that I kept looking and staring at the chirashi)...decided to hand it to me directly (instead of having the waitress to deliver to me).For about $1 less than what I paid at Niji Sushi down the street, I certainly had SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FISH on my chirashi. The fish was also thinner in slices and even though they tasted pretty fresh...I don't think they are superior from the cut I got at Niji..they were just smaller pieces!!! boo!!!My bill came out at $30 including tax and tip. For that price, I would certainly get a lot more food at Niji and I wouldn't have to be seated at the bar!I'm not sure if this is my favorite sushi spot on Castro...I have to say that the hypes definitely don't match to what I experienced here...."
514,No green tea ice cream even though the server said there is. :( Overall food is good - favorite was the Tomi special roll with hamachi.
515,Love the sashimi here! I always get Chirashi when I come here. Their rainbow roll is pretty good too!There is a long line if you don't come early when they open tho.
516,"Fast, fresh, clean, and freaking good fish! What a wonderful sushi joint. Who knew Mountain View had such a hidden gem.They get really busy so come early and put your name down before the wait gets too long!!"
517,"Waitress asked us to order 4 times in as many minutes, then spilled drinks and bowls.  obviously trying touch rush us through dinner.  Food was great, but we couldn't enjoy it."
518,"This review is solely based on the food. I would say I have above average standards for Japanese food, especially sashimi and nigiri. This place is mediocre, and the words my friends and I used is ""terrible"". I ordered the sushi dinner and it was absolutely horrid. Cooked rubbery shrimp, hard still frozen tuna, nothing about that meal was good. It was so bad I even had to spit out a piece of the raw fish. The tonkatsu and beef teriyaki were dry and tough. We also had the tumi special roll but nothing about it  as special. Thank god We didn't try the omakase. If you know good Japanese food, go somewhere else. Waitresses never even came to refill tea or check in on us. But the star rating is solely based on the food."
519,Great sushi and sashimi quality for the price range. I got the chirashi bowl and that was very tasty. The fish was fresh and the temperature was right. I also got an oyakodon which was a little bit too sweet for my liking.
520,"The kidlet, BD, and I were at Ikea in EPA together and was craving nigiri sushi so I went on yelp and found this place. It was early enough that I was hoping I could beat the weekend dinner crowd but boy I was wrong. By the time we got there (a little before 6 pm), there was already a long line and I had to drive around several times to find decent parking. That being said, this place has super delicious & fresh fish! I was a little bummed that they ran out of hotate (both special and regular) but everything else was excellent. If you're looking for a place with clean and not-frozen nigiri, this is the place. We didn't try any of their cooked dishes but perhaps some other time. Service was OK, nothing to write home about nor to complain about. If only it wasn't so far from SF."
521,"The best sushi I've ever had hands down so far in this part of the Bay Area. You definitely cannot beat the decent and reasonably cheap price for that A+ quality sashimi and sushi they serve here. Love how generous they are with how big the slices are and how refreshing and delightful each bite was for their sashimi and rolls. We had the Sushi Tomi roll, sashimi combo, and nigiri combo. My tummy was full and happy when I walked out. Makes a great date spot or intimate catch up with friend for dinner."
522,"Fresh, fantastic value & lightning fast! If you're willing to wait in line outside or lucky as all get out [like I was] then it's a worthwhile sushi excursion. Super prompt service, once you're seated at the sushi bar. Well done, Sushi Tomi!"
523,"Chirashi Chronicles #3I've been hitting up all my favorite sushi restaurants, looking for the best chirashi.  As I usually order nigiri, I kinda dismissed chirashi as mainly leftover sushi cuts for the longest time.  But as I grew more knowledgeable, I realized the higher end chirashi were a fantastic way to sample and enjoy a variety of fish, while eating less rice.  It's like sashimi, but more reasonably priced.  :)I've actually had the regular chirashi at Sushi Tomi and it was forgettable for me.  This time, I opted for the pricier ""Extra Special"" Chirashi and was considerably happier.  Sushi Tomi seemed to combine the best elements of my last two chirashi stops: the quality of Kitsho with the variety of Tomi Sushi.  It's not surprising Sushi Tomi has the same variety as Tomi Sushi given they are sister restaurants, but the quality was a notable step up.  Highlights include: two hotate, two uni, one amaebi, two chutoro, one unagi, one tamago, one kanpachi, two tuna, ikura, and seaweed.  Everything, including the notorious Sushi Tomi uni, was fresh.  The rice wasn't quite the standard of Kitsho, but was quite good and included several sweet flavored mushrooms that I liked as well.  Overall, I couldn't have been happier with the extra special chirashi here.  At $28, it's a premium from the special and regular chirashi, but I don't think you can argue with the fish quality.  Chirashi rankings:1) Sushi Tomi2) Kitsho3) Tomi SushiSushi Tomi takes credit cards, although not American Express."
524,"I'm a big fan of Sushi Tomi. I like their fair prices, great selection, and most especially, I love their ultra quality fish, especially their toro or amaebi. But there's one choice that I've been consistently disappointed with and its about time I called Sushi Tomi out about it. Do NOT order the uni. I've tried their uni several times over the past 2 years and all I ever remember is how bad the experience is. In fact, the last time, I got such bad stomach upset from the poor quality uni, I avoided ordering it at Tomi for a year. That was until last night. Entering Tomi on a windy Sunday, I was impressed at how busy the place was in our recession. I clearly am not among the minority as a fan. We waited with the bustling crowds and were seated in a prime sushi bar location. I eagerly ordered some of my favorites and all were top notch. MY is a big uni fan and I decided to order it as our last selection. Interestingly, the sushi chefs would have forgot without my reminding them. Perhaps this was a subtle nod for us to skip the uni. Too bad I don't do subtle. As their prepared our uni, I was confident Tomi would redeem themselves from our last experience. After all, our other choices had all been fantastic and uni was listed among the white board that we had ordered from and the chef usually lists their fresh choices. Boy, was I wrong. Even as the uni was placed down, I could tell it didn't look right. Dry and too solid, their was none of the shiny look of ocean or freshness that I've been greeted with before. I'm not sure the sushi etiquette regarding returning an item, but I definitely considered it. I decided to just bite it and finish it. Mushy in all the wrong ways and with no salty brininess that fresh uni has, I knew this wasn't good quality. In a few hours, my stomach would tell me the same.  MY was similarly disappointed and she loves the stuff, even going to uni buffets. At $8 an order, it wasn't exactly a bargain either and I felt upset. Tomi, as a high quality sushi institution, you really have to step it up. Either serve better quality uni or do not serve it at all. In comparison to everything else, its just an insult. Worse yet, please don't list that stuff on the white board. It definitely doesn't belong. Sushi Tomi, you're still my favorite sushi place along the Peninsula. But until you step it up, I'm not ordering uni here again. Tough love, baby. Tough love. Anyone know of a nearby place with fresh uni and other items?"
525,"I came here on a whim after seeing the long line and having been to most of the places I wanted to try on Castro.  Hidden on a side street, the restaurant isn't easy to find unless you know where to look...but it's a definite gem.  I've been back two times since and decided to write a quick Yelp blurb.  Like Jim C., I confused it with Sushi TomO (in Palo Alto) and was horrified by the 2 star review average.  How could my fellow Yelpers be so wrong!??!  I felt much better when I found the correct Sushitomi w/ a 4 star review average.  Faith restored in Yelp!The sushi here is excellent and the real star.  You pay for it, but you can expect delicious, first rate sushi.  I recommend their toro (fatty tuna; I love the way it melts) and the uni (only good if it's super-fresh and it is here).  We finished off with amaebi (they fry the heads and serve separately) and the salmon sushi.  Truly top notch.  Check my pics.The decor here is plain like a traditional Japanese restaurant and the service is polite and efficient.  I have yet to try the non-sushi dishes, but from other Yelpers I gather it's merely average.  Stick with the sushi.  It's among the best in the Bay Area.  You won't be sorry."
526,"Our waitress did not come and get us in 10 minutes so it was quite frustrating. They are extremely busy and often have a full house so make sure you're not starving or in a bad mood cause most likely, you got to waitFood is just fine, not extraordinary good or anything but is cheap."
527,"Super fresh fish and in sushi, this is the only thing that in look for! We ordered a ton of stuff, sake, my favorite rolls, and appetizers. The portions surprisingly generous and enough for us three to share. We got the spicy salmon roll, guidances, vegetable tempura--lightly battered and super crisp, one bite and it shattered on impact, the veggies crunchy. Super horse roll was unique--in a good way. Their chicken teriyaki was a bit too sweet for my taste. My wife loves green tea ice cream and theirs was very creamy with a essence of real tea, the coloring was mild and not off putting fluorescent. I'm giving it four stars because the noisy ambience was a bit much for my aging ears. Otherwise this is a fantastic place and would go back on an off night or not at a peak time."
528,"This is my favorite sushi place in the area. Last time we've been there was almost two months ago, we ordered salmon skin roll and dragon roll, nigri and shrimp tempura. It was perfect as always."
529,"Was kind of disappointed but maybe my expectations were too high after reading all the rave reviews. Despite having ""Sushi"" in its name, this restaurant may actually be better for its cooked dishes and bento boxes rather than the sushi. Saw a lot of people order bento boxes of grilled fish, teriyaki chicken, etc which all looked delicious (and also at very good prices). We all opted for sushi. I had the special sushi lunch which was good but just nothing amazing. Definitely not the melt-in-your-mouth delicious kind of quality. The cuts were kind of thick and sloppy and there was too much rice in the nigiri. Would maybe come again and try one of the bento boxes if I'm in the area."
530,"So I didn't get to try too much since I wasn't too hungry and had a spa appt at immersion spa (super awesome btw)Here's what I had:- Futomaki: delicious, tasted like they made their own egg (tamago)- California roll: booooo, mayo-filled crab, couldn't eat it.Service was quick and pretty friendly. Since we had to move tables for another group half-way through our meal, they even threw in a free miso soup! Tips:- A bit on the pricey side, would probably come back for a couple small things but not a gigantic meal.- Lines were long when we left around 7pm, so I'd come early!"
531,"My friend and I dropped by this place for a weekend lunch. When my party arrived, there were already nine parties waiting outside in front of us. Good first sign. Surprisingly, the line shortened rather quickly and we got in within minutes. I ordered the Extra Special Chirashi Bowl. It came with a bowl of miso soup, which was perfect in the cold weather. A few minutes later, the waiter brought the main course over. The sashimi were thick and tasted fresh--several pieces simply melted in my mouth. The tamago was a tad sweet, but otherwise was pretty good. The sushi rice was perfect--at the right grainy texture with the right amount of sushi vinegar. $29 still felt a bit expensive, but it was certainly worth it the first time."
532,"I expected more from this place, so maybe I had too high of expectations and was let down. Came here for lunch this past Saturday, as soon as they opened. It is a small restaurant, but ample seating. I ordered a spicy tuna roll and a 2 item bento, tempura and salmon teriyaki.We were all given miso soup, it seemed more fresh than other restaurants. The spicy tuna was good, but a ton of rice. Their spicy mayo (which I was surprised they had it) was definitley spicy. The bento though was so-so. My brother's didnt even come with a salad, but they only give you a couple bites worth. The salmon teriyaki was okay, but I was dissapointed that their tempura was not good! The batter tastes a bit old and stale, and being one of the first customers there, you'd think itd be fresh, but it did not taste fresh at all. As if it was sitting out for a bit. Too much batter too. They had unusual tempura options like eggplant and green bell pepper. Never seen that before, but since they didn't taste fresh, I didn't like them.Service was decent, but I don't think I'd come back here again."
533,"High quality sushi.Go to Sushi Tomi for one reason: sushi.  Sushi Tomi serves sushi more traditionally than most modern day sushi restaurants, and that's the way I like it.  Pieces are large portioned yet still bite sized.  I sampled the Tomi special roll and the BBQ Eel roll.  The Tomi special was interesting, and possibly the most deviated from tradition roll on the menu.  It comes in a few varieties of flavors, which is an odd but nice touch for people who prefer one fish over another. The eel was incredibly flavorful and melted in my mouth.  I highly recommend the eel for any fans of the salty and sweet seafood.Sushi Tomi's price matches their quality so expect to pay more for your meal.  The restaurant is quite popular too, so come early and put your name on the reservation list before you intend to eat.Overall, a hidden gem in Mountain View's downtown area."
534,"4 years later , I am back with a more sophisticated palette and open mind and I am editing my 2 star to a 4 star !!!!!!!I got all nigiri and sashimi and raw oysters hand rolls and all were AMAZING.  Fresh . Fish cuts were thick buttery and they did not just pack on a giant glob of rice , just enough. I loved ALL of it.  Definitely one of my fave sushi restaurants now and will be returning often.Some ""cons"" but not really .. lines can get long because they're busy and yummy, small space so don't expect a giant party, the oysters were so good but just use a touch more of saltiness/umami , but still delicious."
535,"Whattttt I don't understand how this place has such high reviews.  Came with a couple of friends yesterday and we had a few tuna rolls and it was terrible.  I had to ask for extra ginger to eat with every single bite instead of using it to cleanse my palette.  Terrible service and our waitress looked like her lover just left her for someone else ... Then the other one had the lost dumbfounded look on her far the entire time.  Got Agedashi tofu, was too bland and I just found myself having to dunk it in soy sauce.  The rolls tasted weird, not fresh like every else on here said.  Pricey for that they offer which is limited.  Yelp you let me down."
536,"The absolute worst sushi I have ever had in my life. Even their rice balls were disgusting. The lettuce was old, the sushi wrap was old, the California roll was extremely salty, the spider roll tasted like plastic."
537,"I come to Sushi Tomi usually for their lunch specials, which is available not only on weekdays, but weekends too.They had the mini chirashi don on their specials menu on Sunday, so I got that. For $10.90, I've got to say that it was pretty good value :)The fish was fresh and the portions were generous - I devoured all the fish, but left half my rice. Also ordered a pair of Uni nigiri sushi ($8). Rather generous portion of uni, fresh and flavorful. Yum :)My boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki don with california roll. Portion was once again, huge and he was stuffed by the end. He wasn't very sure about coming here initially since he didnt have a good experience the previous time he had dinner here. But I'm glad I managed to convince him otherwise with their lunch specials :)This place is no kappo nami nami, but I'd say its darn good too :)"
538,"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The poor quality of food and obvious short cuts taken to turn tables over quickly is such an insult. I had the broiled pork belly and chicken skin skewer and both were boiled to death then lightly charred with a blow torch. The pork belly was so tough and leathery and the skin had the texture of rubber. I've given this restaurant about 3-4 chances because the reviews are great but after this last dinner, I will.never come back here again."
539,"Local sushi located in downtown mountain view. I've tried most of the sushi places in the south bay area and I have to say this was very good. I've been here twice and there was a 30 min wait or so each time but wasn't too bad. I really liked the option to get fresh wasabi (unfortunately there is a charge for fresh vs the paste but I have to say it was worth it)Tried many varieties of Nigiri and a few rolls, all of them were fresh and excellent. The rice was also very nice. Server doesn't come by many times in my experience so order what you want up front. Given the quality of fish I can't ding them too bad here. If you're in downtown mountain view and looking for a sushi fix, go try it out!"
540,Long line but worth the wait. Order Omakase Sashimi chef special with appetizer. Everything is fresh and yummy.
541,I don't know why people line up for this place. Maybe the reasonable price. Average everything. I would go again bc it's cheap and good for its price.
542,"The line was forming and I can see why.  Sushi Tomi delivers great quality at standard sushi prices.  For the two of us we thought we went overboard while ordering, but we finished everything!Karage - Cute chicken wings!  With good subtle flavorDeep Fried Gyoza - Standard, small, good textureTomi Special - We ordered this with Hamachi and our minds were blown.  It was so good and so fresh!  A must order!Dragon - Standard rollSuper Bomb - Deep Fried goodnessWe felt like celebrating.... celebrating our gluttony."
543,Great sushi if you like fresh nigiri style sushi. Not a lot of specialty rolls. Can be a long wait. My husband also loves the chicken teriyaki and negi tuna combo
544,Delicious sushi but everyone knows it so be prepared to wait. Street parking so be ready to use your parallel parking skills. I tried the Chirashi. It was beautifully organized and delicious.
545,"I've been wanting to come to this place for a while now but always saw the line of people outside and never came in to try it. I finally had time to try this place out. I came in on a sunday night around 7, there were about 7 parties in front of mine (party of 2) but we were seated in about 20 minutes or so.The service was alright. When I first arrived, I asked the server/worker in front how long he thought the wait would be and he told me I would have to ask the host and then walked away. I didn't see a host at all and he didn't tell/show me who she was. After coming back 10 minutes later, I got someone's attention who turned out to be the host and then the wait wasn't much longer after that.Once we were seated, we took our time looking at the menu, maybe 7 minutes or so. But within that time we were asked for our order at least 3 times. So we felt a bit rushed. We finally ordered our food, I had the regular sashimi (3 pcs of tuna, salmon, and yellowtail) for $20, an order of yellowtail nigiri which was $6.40 but they charged me an extra $2 to have it seared (a little expensive imo), and then the katsu don. The fish tasted great and fresh, and everything came out very fast. The katsu don came out first and was good as well, but the egg on top made the pork soggy. I ordered another seared yellowtail nigiri and this took a while. About 15-20 minutes later, we were asked if we were ready for the check but let them know that we were still waiting on our sushi. Then the server brought it out right away. Since I ordered it seared, I expected it to be at least warm. But it was significantly cold, so I assume that it has been sitting out for all this time and the server forgot to bring it out to us. This is the main reason why I'm giving 3 stars instead of 4, because I could definitely taste the difference with the sushi just sitting out like that after being seared.I would definitely come back to try a more variety of fish, but I think the service could use some improvement."
546,"This is my favorite sushi place in the South Bay.  Their fish is always fresh, their staff is friendly.  Do be prepared to wait, as there always seems to be a line, however it does move pretty quickly.  If you want to sit around and linger with your group this is maybe not the place, but if you want great sushi here's your place.  It's also walking district to Castro St. so if you need like ice cream after you can just walk down the street."
547,"Probably the best sushi I've had in Silicon Valley.  Really more 4.5 than 5 though because it doesn't really compare with the top spots I've been to in NYC.  That said, the quality really is a cut above the rest of the options around here.  The service, while rushed has generally been quite good.  Bonus points for the Kid's Bento which really was quite great and a good value.  While it certainly isn't cheap, it is worth every penny."
548,"One of our fav spots for more high end sushi in the South Bay Area. Coming from a larger city, were used to having access to all sorts of sushi whenever we please.. after moving to Sunnyvale we found we were only able to find the lower end comfort stuff (which is fine), until we stumbled upon Tomi.Lines are long so go early and be prepared. Wait is worth it though! Highly recommend the Hamachi special roll."
549,"I would leave zero stars if I could but I guess the squishy rice was worth a star. I waited 50 minutes to even enter the restaurant. The hostess had no idea what she was doing and seated a one person party to a four person table. Parties after parties were seated before us, leaving us the last group to walk in, greeted with a last call announcement. Everything was going alright until we got the check and decided to leave a very small tip due to slow service and lack of hospitality. The hostess stopped us at the door to notify us we left less than a 15% tip and would not let us leave until we did. Honestly can't even believe that happened."
550,"While I was down visiting my boyfriend for the weekend, we were both craving sushi and I stumbled upon Tomi Sushi on Yelp. We came for a late lunch on a Saturday and were seated right away. The place was crowded, so that was a good sign. The service was fast, friendly, and attentive. As for the food, I settled upon the Tomi Lunch Box with chicken teriyaki and tempura. It came with rice, soup, and salad. My boyfriend got the lunch box with tempura and sashimi. We also ordered a spicy tuna roll and rainbow roll to share. There was plenty of food for the two of us. The price was decent for what you get. The sushi itself was ok - I've definitely had better. The rolls were ""mushy"" and easily fell apart when you picked them up. The chopsticks seemed to ""cut"" right through them. Overall, decent sushi for the location and price. But not the best I've ever had. I'd come back if I was in the area and craving sushi bad enough."
551,Very fresh fish (sashimi or sushi).  They are a little more tradition Japanese so their rolls are more authentic which means you won't find a full menu of rolls named after every hi-tech company in the area.  Instead the rolls tend to be simple.  I go here if I want to focus on fresh fish.  I go elsewhere if I'm in the mood for monster rolls (I do like those Americanized rolls with everything in it).This is run by Japanese (not a Korean sushi place).  Apparently this is the place to be so there seems to always be a wait to get in.4/17/2015 update:  they now have a few Americanized rolls like the Dragon Roll.  It is good.  Still can't go wrong with their fresh fish.
552,Quite popular place for dinner in mtv downtown. They have many different type of rolls as well as dons.
553,"There's not much to dislike about Sushi Tomi aside from the prices (although it's worth it for the quality). Their fish is always super fresh, and they have a large variety of different fishes (including some flown in from the Tsukiji fish market in Japan). This time around, I placed an order for pick-up, and got:-Rainbow Roll ($14?), Sake Nigiri ($7?) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-tomi-mountain-view?select=1Z2nZ7Gorw9OEHHbnk0SpA#1Z2nZ7Gorw9OEHHbnk0SpA]: The bf had this and really enjoyed his rainbow roll, and sake nigiri. All the fish were really fresh.-Nigiri Sushi (Special, $21, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-tomi-mountain-view?select=1Z2nZ7Gorw9OEHHbnk0SpA#fuRptkGgp2vxqJKTrHWz0Q): Yum! I loved the assortment of fish, although I wish they gave me less tuna. However, the tamago was actually really delicious, as well as the uni and ikura. Highly recommended!It was easy to place the order over the phone, but they don't have their full menu posted online, so it's difficult to order rolls and nigiri sushi unless you want to ask the hostess to read off all the choices. I would highly recommend dining in, and making reservations (it doesn't matter if it's lunch or dinner, this place is always packed). Parking can be difficult, but street parking is available and there is also a parking lot across the street."
554,"A restaurant that is packed for lunch on a MONDAY?? You know it's got to be good! I've been to Sushi Tomi a few times for dinner, but this was my first time for lunch (and first review). This is one of the best places for fresh sashimi in the Bay Area, in my opinion. At night the menu is much more extensive, but they have a good selection available for lunch. Luckily, I called in advance to make a reservation (a MUST, if possible), and were able to bypass the cluster of people in the front (noon on a Monday). We opted for:-Tomi Bento (Beef Teriyaki, Saba, Tempura, 3 pc California Roll, $12.40): Good deal for the price, but the beef quality wasn't very good, and the meat was very chewy. I would opt for the chicken next time. The tempura had a good variety, but I wish they had more squash or some eggplant pieces instead of the green bell pepper. The saba was really good and they gave you a sizeable piece. I enjoyed the Cal Roll since I think they mixed the crab with some mayo. Could have been imitation crab though..-Extra Special Nigiri Sushi (8 pieces of nigiri + 6 piece Fatty Tuna Roll, $28.00): Nigiri consisted of: toro, sake, hirame belly, uni, unagi, amaebi, and two pieces that I wasn't sure what they were. I enjoyed the toro, hirame belly, sake, and uni the best. The amaebi was ok, but the crispy shrimp head part was probably the best I've had at any sushi place. I didn't enjoy the assortment all that much, but it was ok.Overall, Sushi Tomi has some of the freshest fish you'll find in this area, and also one of the larger selections. Next time, I'll opt for ordering my nigiri a la carte since I can choose the ones I like versus a crapshoot with the nigiri sets. Service is quick and efficient, despite them being really busy, and you can also get take-out. Parking can be tough, but they have a lot across the street so it's not as bad as the parking situation on Castro St."
555,"Their sashimi comes in large portions which was cool until i realized it was sloppy and not cut correctly which was a shame and really limited my enjoyment. I'm not sure if it was the cut or the quality of the fish that resulted in chewy and far from melt in your mouth sashimi. It was such a huge turn off. The service was okay. The large boat sushi looks like a great deal if you are with friends, but i honestly couldn't stomach their sushi."
556,"I've been hearing a lot of great things about this place and I was super excited when a friend of mine decided to come here for his birthday dinner. The wait wasn't too bad, but the service was beyond belief horrible. The waitress who took our order was super rude. At the end of our order, she asked, ""No soup or salad?"" I politely asked if they were included and she responded with attitude, ""No! I wouldn't have had to ask if they were included ma'am....""Let's just say she will be receiving no tip."
557,"We've come by three separate times and all three times there has been a line out the door and a 30+ minute wait.  We finally stuck around to find out what the big deal is.  The answer, nothing.  Absolutely nothing. We got an assortment of rolls and nigiri.  The service was fine, a couple mistakes, a little slow, but pretty par for the course for similarly busy sushi restaurants.  The sushi was fine.  It was fresh, but nothing special and nothing horrible.  The prices were fine, they were neither super cheap nor super expensive (at least for downtown Mountain View).  So why the 30 minutes wait for an absolutely average sushi place?  I have no idea."
558,"Sushi lunch combo was perf! Quick, good, In and out. (That's What She Said) HahaAnywho, yes!!! Fresh and tasty!"
559,"I have tried multiple times in this restaurant. Overall, lunch menus are good. But Omakase is not worth ROI. Nothing special/ quality is low. I couldn't see the difference between special sushi vs. omakase sushi. The main dish (both Sashimi and Sushi) were really mediocre.The hostess (young lady at the counter) is not professional. i still recommend the restaurant for quick lunch but this is not a place for nice dinner."
560,It's a small restaurant neat downtown Mountain View. Not much to look at from outside but you can tell by big line outside the restaurant.  The fish is fresh and always a pleasure to let the chef prepare a dish for you.  Highly recommended but make sure you are first to arrive as they get very busy.
561,"I've gone back several times with co-workers and friends. Food is really just mediocre and I don't think it's worth the price.  My first time experience was the worst (from my first review), but after going back in groups, and we've ordered with no budget constraint once, I really feel like there are other better sushi restaurants in the area, let alone the bay, that you can spend equal amount of money and get something better. Not sure if sushi tomi at cupertino is owned by the same owner, but that one is way better."
562,"Horrible service and attitude. Went during lunch and was very disappointed of the quality.  The chirashi i had was like of leftover fish pieces and the young manager rudely told us ""this is what you get for lunch prices"" when we complained.  I also got sick couple hours after eating at that place. I don't understand the good reviews and will never try that place again.  There are other much better alternatives to dine at downtown mountain view."
563,"I want to give Sushi Tomi 5 stars... I really do. It's a solid place, with good quality fish and delicious cooked food. They also offer omakase, which is a chef choice of 10 pc nigiri and appetizers. They are usually pretty good. However, the quality of the appetizers is inconsistent. I have been absolutely wow'ed and also been really disappointed. We used to go to Sushi Tomi for celebration dinners, but not any more because of the unpredictability in quality. The service is also mediocre. There is also a long wait if you didn't come within 15 min of opening. Since it's so popular, it can also get really crowded. With a baby in the tow now, I'd rather go with something that is more spacious and reliable."
564,Amazing food!! I had extra special sushi dinner! Omg delicious!!! I like sitting at the sushi bar because you can see what chefs are doing! I recommend the sushi bar!
565,Love their sushi!  So sad we can't dine in right now. The service is a bit rough at times because they are so busy. But the food is great!!!
566,After reading all the positive reviews i decided that i have to visit this sushi resturant and I am glad that i did. the sushi was well made and the service was great i had a few diffrant rolls and i enjoyed all of them.
567,great sushi and bento boxes for reasonable prices. recommend the Tomi Special Roll.
568,"Don't really understand why there's a line for this place. We ordered sushi sets - and there is absolutely no seasoning in the rice. Rice was too dry and too much for the nigiri, so it resulted in unbalanced taste. Some pieces had little to no wasabi, while others had quite a bit. No complaints about the quality of the fish itself though - but the price was a bit high. Kula sushi had much better taste & price...The salad that came with it had way too much sauce as well."
569,"**TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE** they started  yelling at me when there was a customer service issue. This is what happened:I ordered the lunch bento and when it came out, there was an error.  I asked the waiter (his name is T) and instead of saying ""woops my bad"" or ""sorry"" he proceeded to yell and me and say that this is what I ordered.  No, it wasn't what I ordered and my lunch mate agreed.  I asked him calmly if he could just swap it out, no big deal.  NO WE CAN'T DO THAT- NO SUBSTITUTIONS.  Well dude, #1 stop yelling and spewing streams of spit in my face and #2 you screwed up my order, i'm not asking for a substitution.  Then out of nowhere another waitress named Pauline (older asian lady) walks up on my other side and starts yelling at me and waving the menu in my face.  So now, I have T on my rightside yelling and Pauline on my left side yelling.  THey've boxed me in and are spitting, waving menus (less than an inch from my face) and embarrassing me in the middle of the restaurants.  I asked for the manager- never appeared.  When it came time for the check, they literally threw it at my friend who had to catch it.  Don't go here.  The food is mediocre Japanese sushi/bento and the service is appalling.  There are hundreds of other places that deserve your business- not this one."
570,"Pretty good. Not the best sushi ever but then again we were only here for lunch and didn't get any of the ""fancy imported specials"".Since Mo and me are still on reintroduction from Whole30 we went pretty basic and got the sashimi lunch with double salad no rice. The lunch combos all come with the basic miso soup, salad, and rice.Definite props to our waitress who brought us 2 different kinds of salad dressing and explained what was in each without us even asking (Just in case we couldn't have one or the other). Great service right there. Anyways our sashimi was very fresh and had good portioning for $12. I would definitely come back...given there isn't a line the size of the Great Wall outside."
571,"I have eaten a lot of sushi in my life. A lot. If I had a piece of sushi for every piece of sushi I've eaten, it would be a lot. Sushi Tomi is consistently one of the best Japanese restaurants I've eaten at, and it holds up to some of the better restaurants in Japan that I've been to.Today I went to lunch with my wonderful wife (which is always a treat in itself), and part of my order was nigiri sake (salmon), and it was, I believe, the best sake I've ever had in my life. Wow, was it amazing.Tomi is a little more expensive than some other Japanese restaurants, but I'd rather eat out less often and get the best. You'll never get a raw deal here. Well, I mean...."
572,"Excellent sushi for the general  penninsula area.  Actually, an excellent choice for the bay area.  Good pricing for pretty generous meal portions.  Their 2 choice combo has a good selection to choose from and is filling because it includes tea, soup and a small salad.  Their sushi offerings have both the typical rolls and nigiri but thru also have more exotic offerings as well.Have been here several times and have never been disappointed.  Yes, there is usually a wait but it's usually not long but well worth it."
573,"It is crowded, even it is not weekend. Waiting time is around 30 mins. The sashimi is so good, it is very fresh and high quality. Saba shioyaki, beef teriyaki and chicken teriyaki are really full enough for 1.5 people. The dinner/luchn special comes with salad and miso soup. Overall, Sushi Tomi is definitely great  Japenese restaurant in Bay Area."
574,"Just okay. I've driven past this restaurant for ages and have seen the infamous out the door lines so I never tried to have dinner here. I finally had a sushi craving and reason to celebrate so I came here on a weekend for lunch. There wasn't a like but there were multiple people still on the waiting list all we waited about 15 minutes as people showed up and got seated since that had put their name down earlier. Once we were seated, I could tell the service was going to be lackluster. We were given menus and after several minutes offered water. And then nothing. The menu doesn't indicate what type of fish is included in the sashimi and sushi lunches which was annoying so I had to ask due to food allergies. Our waitress seemed very inconvenienced by the fact I asked. And after all that, how was the food? Just average. My sushi lunch was a good portion-3 pieces of delicious Cali roll, 3 pieces tuna, 3 pieces cucumber, 5 pieces nigiri (1 salmon, tuna, yellow tail, shrimp, and a seared fish I never got the name of.. Maybe amberjack?). You also get 3 pieces of broccoli in a mysterious yellow orange sauce, which I was apparently allergic to one of the sauce ingredients so I didn't finish. Miso soup was great and you also get a salad before the bento box is brought out. My husband got his typical teriyaki chicken bento box and it was a good sized meal but he said quality wise it was nothing to write home about. Overall I'm glad I tried this place but don't think I'll be back. The wait and price doesn't justify the meal unfortunately. It's hyped up because of the quality of fish but I'm sure you could get the same elsewhere."
575,"Sushi Tomi is known for its amazing fresh sushi, variable but always yummy menu - and long waits in the cold outside. They're a bit slow turning their tables, so just bring a coat and the wait is worth it.Fatty tuna nigiri is my fave, but the deep fried spicy tuna handroll is good too. You really can't go wrong. Quick service as well."
576,"The nigiri special is an excellent deal with really great pieces of fish for the price. You put your name on a list outside, and it moves quite quickly. I love that you're served edamame and miso soup upon ordering, too. Also nice that this is off the beaten path."
577,"I called a week in advance to make reservations for a Sunday dinner. I called the day before to confirm. However, when I checked in for dinner, they said there were no reservations under my name. :-( they kept asking me if I called their SJ location by accident so I showed them the call log on my phone which showed the correct location. Fortunately, they had a table available. With that out of the way....Ordered a ton of nigiri:-tobiko with raw quail egg yolk-sake toro - Melts in your mouth-hamachi toro-amaebi-unagi-scallop-tako-spider roll-agedashi tofu-white tuna tataki - DELICIOUS!-stuffed chicken wingsThe fish were all very fresh. However, I would not recommend the stuffed chicken wings though. It was $8 for 2 wings. We normally get and end with toro but at $15/pair we decided to pass on it this time. Most of the nigiri pairs above were around $6-7.I'll definitely be back..."
578,"Short story:Overrated sushi.Long story:I went here with friends and the place was packed.  I saw previous yelp reviews that said this was the sushi place to go to.  But overall the sushi was bland and overpriced.  Maybe I had high expectations because of the high ratings.  Therefore, I'm willing to try them one more time."
579,"I honestly really enjoy eating at this place. Even though this place is almost always crowded whenever I go. So when you do want to give this place a try, see if you can make a reservation first! The wait can be tremendous but if you want some warm tea to sip on while waiting, I do believe the workers would be more than happy to accommodate. I've seen it happen.This establishment is pretty tiny but if you are looking for this place, be sure to be looking for a bunch of people crowding in front of a building. That's the place you're looking for. Parking can be challenging because of how populated that area usually is. There is a parking lot across from the restaurant which is very convenient but a majority of times that I've gone, that parking lot was full. You may have to drive around to find parking ... like driving around several times.Onto the food! Their sushi is pretty fresh compared to several other sushi places I've tried. How do I know? Their uni. I'm not an expert when it comes to fish but one of the things that makes it so easy for me to tell is when I eat uni. When uni is fresh, it's sweet and tastes amazing, especially with rice. However, when the uni is not fresh, it is disgusting and all you can taste is salt water. Aside from their uni, their fatty tuna is also amazing. It melts in your mouth! Whenever I come to Sushi Tomi, I just have to have a piece of their fatty tuna. It just makes my night awesome. And when you add their fresh uni onto the same night, I'm just on cloud 9 playing some ukulele music and cloud hopping. My favorite thing to get from Sushi Tomi has got to be their extra special chirashi. It's in a wooden container, sushi rice at the bottom, and an assortment of sashimi on top of the rice. Not only sashimi but a bit of tamago and seaweed salad to boot! Oh, you get uni AND toro as part of the assortment as well! Fresh, amazing, and absolutely satisfying. Love this place! Don't hesitate to give it a try. Can't go wrong! Though, with all good sushi places, it's not cheap so ... don't expect it to be but it's also not expensive! It's pretty average in pricing as long as you don't go crazy? Haha!"
580,They take lunch reservations.Green hot tea is fantastic.Udon is very good- I suggest ordering this.Entrees plates are goodSushi ok
581,"This was a really good Japanese place, one of the best that I've been to in the area! I went during lunchtime on a weekday with my friend so it was a little bit busy (we had to wait around 10 minutes), but nothing crazy so that was great. The service was really fast (probably because they were trying to turnover tables quickly) so that was excellent as well. I decided to order the salmon teriyaki and my friend ordered a sushi bento box. For me, the salmon was really delicious. The portion sizes were pretty generous for the price I was paying and the fish definitely tasted fresh and light (sometimes Japanese restaurants will put too much teriyaki sauce on, but this was not the case). My friend had a complaint about the amount of wasabi that was on her sushi which overpowered the sushi a little bit, but I can't speak for her so this rating is a reflection of my experience. Overall, this is a really good Japanese place and I personally would recommend it to anyone else looking for great Japanese food!"
582,"Dinner combination: Spicy chicken miso nabe, tempura. It was pretty good!! Wait time for Friday night: 45 mins This place is pretty legit. My husband had the sashimi and he thought it was v good. Polite service! There's also a parking lot in front of restaurant but maybe busy on weekends and you might find it hard to find parking around the area."
583,"Pricey but tasty, would come again.Gizzards too chewy but chicken skin tasty. Caterpillar roll really big with rice, but still good. Fried oysters good but a lot of breading. Salmon, roe, and unagi nigeri all good. Spinach with sweet miso good. Bill was $90 with taxCame before 6 pm sat night and got seated quickly, got busy afterwards with long line. Dragon roll: meh-- had lettuce and too much rice.Combo dinner special had ample portion of salmon sashimi"
584,"Pricey but tasty, would come again.Gizzards too chewy but chicken skin tasty. Caterpillar roll really big with rice, but still good. Fried oysters good but a lot of breading.

585,"I've eaten here a handful of times over the past 10 plus years or so, and I think the quality (sadly) is not as good as before.  I went last Saturday night, so it should have been the best available food (prime restaurant dining day and time). This place used to all about the fresh fish. I rarely eat raw sushi because I'm rather picky about it. When I do, it has to be very fresh and very good.  The spicy tuna roll we had wasn't too great.  Also I ordered a hamachi kama that looked like someone had already taken a chunk out of and eaten... a little disturbing.  Didn't stop me from devouring it, of course. Not the most fresh hamachi kama I've had, but it was decent - definitely not the worst."
586,"Amazing food. The downside is the long waiting list.Been here once. Came here 10 minutes before it opened. There was still a line. We were able to get sat right away. Make sure all your party is there, otherwise they wont sit you. Just around noon, this place was packed~!!! Thankfully I didn't experience the long line, but for sure there was a long line outside while we were eating.The nigiri is super fresh, authentic Japanese.Will definitely come here next time with my wife so she could try it as well."
587,"This is the first Sushi place I've visited since moving to Mt View. We (3 people) arrived around 8:45/9PM on a Saturday night. It was fairly busy but a few empty tables had us seated in seconds. Apparently the wait would have been long if we arrived an hour earlier. Within minutes of sitting down we had 2 servers come up to grab our drink orders and food orders before we even had time to look at the menu. We had the bomb roll, rainbow roll, tempura, and chicken teriyaki. Rainbow roll was OK, I've had better. The bomb roll (forgot the name) was AMAZING. There was NOT a bad choice in what we ordered so I highly recommend ordering multiple dishes and sharing!!We also ordered Sake and Sapporo. What's dinner without sake right?! It seemed like a great place for small families, and a cute date spot. Anyway, service can be better as we were a bit rushed but I attribute It to being later in the night - I would definitely come back again!!"
588,"Well of course it's good. There's no denying that this place serves fresh pieces of fish that are of high quality. I'd definitely come again, no doubt in mind. With that being said, I've also been to the San Jose residing, Tomi Sushi. Since they have similar names and mirrored menus, I decided to order the same dishes and compare the experience. I got the extra special chirashi bowl, nigiri lunch, and the salmon Kama (this was a lunch special so I had to try). So service was great. Everyone was nice and this waitress apologized for the 20-30 minute wait for a table. Food was pretty good too. The salmon Kama gave the most bang for it's buck. The two other dishes are the reason why this place couldn't reach 5 stars. Both the chirashi and the nigiri could've been plated better and made more appetizing. The nigiri lunch wasn't that great since it was just 6 nigiri and a maki roll. It all tasted great but I certainly was left wanted the experience I had with the San Jose Tomi Sushi."
589,"I walked into Sushi Tomi expecting some scrawny nerd that I could hit and quit but I was profoundly startled to find that he's a genuine, very popular, and very dreamy guy. Not that I care, I'm just here for something quick and dirty. Anyway, I got my usual. I'm a simple girl with simple tastes and a bowl of clumsily large raw fish on some satisfactory rice would've been fine but I guess Tomi's into that craftsmanship or something so I got a chirashi that had multiple flavor profiles mixed in. He had that umami shit on lock. Not that I was impressed. Or whatever. Oh my God. He also has an omakase special. Do you think he'll call me back?"
590,Best sushi I've had in the Bay Area.  The rolls taste super fresh.  The prices are also very fair.
591,"This is my go-to in both Japanese food and in my Castro street selection. The restaurant is fairly small and gets pretty busy during peak hours, but the atmosphere still manages to stay personable. I've never felt like anyone was up in my elbow room. I've had almost everything on the main menu and have to say it's all amazing. My favorites are the broiled mackerel / Saba, the tonkatsu, and the agedashi tofu. PS sashimi cuts are generous!"
592,"Sushi Tomi is located a few blocks away from Castro street so the street isn't so crowded, however, there will usually be a wait here. It's a relatively small place with a location with no flashy gimmicks, just good sushi here. I waited about 25 minutes for a seat at the bar. The quality of the sushi was amazing and the ambience is very traditional yet laid back. Very affordable and tasty, can't wait to come back!"
593,We've waited a long time to come and well worth the wait. The sushi is super fresh and the grilled items were very savory. The chicken yakitori and gyoza were expertly prepared. The combination dinners were very generous with portion sizes.
594,I Love sushi and I love this one I love the people there it's a small place and doesn't seem so tempting to go in but once you go in you'll realize. The raw fish is so good!
595,"The food was really good and service was quick. The only issue was that we felt very rushed when they were about to close. I'd rate this as a top 3 Japanese spot in Mountain View. My group of 3 had teriyaki chicken, tempura, 2 special sushi rolls, Saki and Sapporo. They all were amazing and it left us very full when leaving."
596,"Good food, ambience a bit quieter than the place next door (still talkative). The common fishes are very good. I am nay on the tempura though, super soaked in oil."
597,"This place is now my favorite sushi restaurant!Everything we ordered yesterday was delicious!  Simple, yet fresh!Sashimi dinner all just melted in the mouth and the fresh oysters were prepared perfectly...I was a very happy customer!We also ordered the omakase after realizing it was offered from reading the chalk board hanging over the sushi bar.  Next time I am just going for the $38 meal. You get three appetizers and the chef's choices.  Deep fried baby octopus was great! And surprisingly the monk fish liver was one of my favorite things to eat that night!  Nigiri galore!  I want to go back already!  I got there at 6pm yesterday and the wait list already started! When the bar opened I opt for faster seating! Make sure you indicate that table and bar seating is what you would like when writing on the wait list.  I suggest you get there eArly! There's a parking lot across the street and not a far walk from downtown mountain view.  Service is great!  If you haven't given this place a try, make sure it's on your to eat list!"
598,"Consistently fresh and tasty fish. Only cons are it's pretty pricey (well worth it though!), they don't take reservations and wait times are lonnnggg to get in - my husband and I got there at 5:10pm on Saturday, just 10 minutes after they open, and already there was a line. Our wait was about 25 minutes. Come during lunch for slightly cheaper prices and shorter lines, if it bothers you.  If you like sashimi I suggest the special sashimi for $29. The dragon roll, spicy tuna, and even they're California (usually a roll we skip) are some favorites as well. Large warm sake for $7. It's house but it gets the job done. Sake sampler is cold sake only, unfortunately, but worth a try once."
599,Always good food here. The service is quick and efficient.  Good value for the money. And the sashimi is fresh. Try the Omakase; you will love it!
600,"The sushi here does not disappoint. Very high class with soft fish and greatly packed rice. We splurged with the uni, and the flavor was on point. There is definitely no lapse in quality here! That explains the 2 hour wait time after placing a phone order!!"
601,"I had initially gone to Sushi Tomi before Yelp existed when I didn't fully appreciate sushi but enjoyed my experience.. Fast forward to now, I have been to Japan a couple of times and love sushi and still love coming here. Sushi Tomi manages to provide quality sushi mid pandemic."
602,"This is my go-to spot in the Peninsula when I'm craving fresh sashimi. I always get the extra special chirashi bowl ($29), which comes with a generous side of uni (sea urchin) and amaebi (raw shrimp). I've never experienced any issues with the freshness or quality of the food, and their prices are more than fair considering the quality and quantity. The roll selection is very sparse, and has only about 8 or so choices, most of which is the more generic options (spicy tuna, salmon and avocado etc). The only one we really ever order is the Tomi Special roll ($14.90), which allows you to customize the top with either hamachi (yellowtail), sake (salmon), or spicy tuna. Dragon and caterpillar roll are good, but nothing terribly special to write home about. This is definitely my favorite place for quality and freshness, but if you're looking for fancier rolls or more Americanized meals, this is probably not the best choice. However, get here early as there is almost always a ridiculous wait during peak dinner  hours. There is a public parking lot across the street that's generally full, but since this is located off of Castro, you can usually get lucky with residential street parking nearby."
603,"Service is excellent but food is below expectation.Almost everyone of the special is sold out, and no uni sushi which is on regular menu.The Smelt was great, it have a nice charcoal taste to it and the mayo is a great pairing.The ikura ochusuka is a bit on the cold side but the tea have strong flavor which works ok with the ikura if it was hot.The hamachi nigiri was bad the rice is stuck on the plate and there is no wasabi in between the fish and rice.The monk fish liver have a weird sour taste to it, he sauce is over powering the liver.Overall this is a so-so experience."
604,"Average. I prefer Geta Sushi in Oakland much better (and a whole lotttt cheaper). We got the tomi special bento and the sashimi. Fish is fresh but not the nicest presentation/cut. Chicken teriyaki is ok. Tempura is good and you get different vegetable plus one shrimp. Radish purée is not smooth. You can tell everything just lacks that special attention to detail. They are very busy so they don't really check on you, which is understandable. Overall, nothing really stood out. The food, service, price are all just average."
605,"I like Sushi Tomi a lot!I went there on Sat for dinner with my husband. Although we were there 5 min before the opening (5 PM), the waitress let us in! That never happened to me before at any other restaurants.We sat at the sushi bar and ordered in Japanese way (you order a small amount as you go). The sushi and service were really good. The fish was fresh, tea was strong, and the sushi was very authentic. All 3 sushi chefs are Japanse. The restaurant got filled right after the opening. I recommend getting there early, even before the opening time."
606,"Grossly overrated!  Unbearably noisy. Over seasoned eal rolls, soggy rice. Mayonnaise laden California rolls and inedible oily mayonnaise base salad dressing! Bad experience!!!"
607,"The sushi is amazing... but if you put your name down and your whole party is not there, they will skip you. This is ok, but what is NOT ok is the order in which they seat you when your party is there. Instead of being next, they will rotate between others who have signed up after you! This extended my wait time by an additional 30 min and I watched 10 groups who came after us get seated. WTF. You might as well put your name on the list again. That is not a well thought out or fair system at all. Basically, if you get skipped go somewhere else. Or... sign your name up twice on the list. One star for this system, please change how you deal with seating people."
608,"We came here on a Friday night around 7. Waiting time was only about 20 minutes.We ordered a dinner combination of Saba Shioyaki and beef sukiyaki (add $3) w/ miso soup and seasame salad, a special chirashi and Anago Onigiri. Very fulfilling for two people. The dinner combination was a good value (the sukiyaki pot was entree portion!) Everything is perfect except the sukiyaki beef was a bit overcooked. Will come back!FYI, there is a big parking lot right across the street."
609,"This is the second time my husband and I have came here for lunch and I'm stuffed to the point where I don't/can't eat anymore but I ended up ordering more food to go because it was just so delicious. I had hot green tea with two avocado rolls, spicy tuna roll, and salmon avocado roll and I was in heaven. My husband ordered the salmon nigiri and scallop nigiri. This place is definitely a go to if in downtown Mountain View! Service was excellent too! The rolls were so fresh!!! Mouth watering!!!"
610,"great unagi don! It's my must-eat food every weekend:)) addicted to this place! Another thing is their Salmon (sake) Sashimi never lets me down. Never. I have tried many things on the menu and you can't go wrong with these two.  And yes, always go there when they just opened to avoid the long line."
611,My top two places for sushi in the Bay Area. My parents have been taking me here since I was little. My dad worked for a Japanese company and would take his clients out here. There is always a wait so be prepared to write your name down and walk around the downtown!
612,"This has become one of my favorite places for fresh fish and sushi. If it wasn't so far, I'd probably be here everyday and living on the streets cause I couldn't pay rent.The fish here is extremely fresh and delicious. I don't really get anything else. Chriashi bowls, sake bowls, hamachi kama, and other sushi or sashimi items are my go-tos. Plus they have my absolute favorite fish/cut here: sake toro AKA fatty salmon. Aww yeah!The service is the reason I'm knocking off one star. The chefs seem okay, nothing special. But the servers are usually pretty cold and our waters are usually pretty low. They'll lie about the wait time and I've watched them tell multiple parties that the wait time is ""30 minutes"", no matter how long the list is.Anyways... fish. Fresh fish. I'm down."
613,"Hands down my favorite sushi joint in the area. Super fresh and delicious sushi rolls, sashimi, and hot dishes. Expect a wait during lunch/dinner time - for a reason! Today, me and my high school friend tried the DRAGON ROLL (shrimp tempura, avocado, $11), the SPICY TUNA ($9) - the rice was as very soft and delightful - and the obvious MISO SOUP. They also offer entrees such as Teriyaki Chicken but I haven't tried any of those.You're guaranteed to get a decent value for your buck - well presented, fresh sushi. Like!"
614,"This is one of our go to spots for take out sushi during C19.  It's not always easy to reach them as the phone either drops or keeps ringing, attesting to their popularity.  Their sashimi is reasonably priced and fresh.  One of my favorite is the churashi special, and my wife often will get the salmon special.  It isn't as specialized as some of the places in SF or LA but for basic no nonsense good quality fish, it's hard to find on the peninsula.  It's located a bit off the main strip and parking is reasonably easy with a lot across the way as well as by the restaurant."
615,"Good place for sushi!Generally you wait 10 minutes before you can find a seat on weekend noons. There is a sign-in sheet at the entrance. Make sure you put your name on it so that you are in the waitlist.The food is nice and with good service. The price is reasonable. I just order their special or extra-special sushi combo. Will try other items in the future.A bit defects: sometimes the rice is a bit too sticky. And, if you order oysters, make sure they don't add the sauce. The default is to serve with the sauce, which is intolerable to me."
616,"This place is popular. We got here just as they were opening and there was already a line outside but we were able to get seated right away. The service was quick and attentive. The lunch specials here are a really great deal.I got the sushi lunch ($15). The sushi was fresh and tasty. It came with a side of broccoli, 3 pieces of california roll, 3 pieces of tuna, 3 pieces of cucumber, and 5 nigiri. It definitely satisfied my sushi craving without costing me too much.Overall I would definitely be back here again."
617,Over priced for the quality. Ordered Omakase with 10 pieces of nigiri but none of the it stood out except for the med fatty tuna and lean tuna.The uni had a rancid taste which I had to spit out and I never spit out Uni as it's one of my favorite pieces. Super hyped and not worth the wait.
618,"It's very traditional sushi. Expected more variety, not as creative as you'd hope. The pictures may look more attractive but the sushi itself is just a bit on the down side."
619,"I recommend coming here early, because it gets busy!Ordered the lunch special of broiled salmon for $9.50. It came with miso soup and salad.  The miso soup was awesome because it had pieces of salmon in it!  The fish was very fresh and tasty!I would definetely come back, but only if I was early as I hate waiting."
620,"So glad I made reservations before showing up! I suggest you do too. This place is really popular. And now I know why. The four of us shared:Nigiri sushi regular: I didn't try any but everyone said the fish is fresh.Miso sea bass: 3/5 overcooked, did not melt in my mouth... Beef wrapped roll: 3/5 this was very interesting, but I prefer the tomi rolls.Caterpillar roll: 5/5 very fresh and delicious!Special Tomi Rolls: 5/5 We ordered 3 tomi rolls, salmon, spicy tuna and Hamachi. All were excellent. Food was served in a reasonable about of time and our tea was refilled in a quick manner. We will be back. Soon I hope!"
621,"Waited about 20-30 minutes on a Friday around 6:30 or 7 but as others have said, it's worth the wait! Almost every table we saw had an order of the House Special roll and we ordered it too, without even knowing what we were getting (that's my one gripe, I wish they had pictures or descriptions of their rolls!). It was good, but the highlight of the dinner was the nigiri. Love love loved my uni with quail egg (and I better have, at $9 for an order!) and the salmon roe came with a heaping scoop of eggs. I also got a tempura udon (my go-to for cold nights) but it was nothing special. The tempura had too much batter on it for me, and I felt heavy after eating 1 piece so picked off the batter on the rest of them and just ate the inside.I'd come back to try the omakase and/or more nigiri. The onigiri were also very large and had a lot of filling, so worth the price.Make reservations if you can!"
622,"Coming in around 730pm, I expected a long wait, but I was pleasantly surprised to immediately find seating. I've heard of how fresh the sashimi here is so I couldn't resist ordering the platter. The sashimi platter comes with 3 thick pieces of salmon, tuna, white tuna, and yellowtail. This dish is probably the first time I've been able to tell the difference between yellowtail and all the other seafood. Normally the yellowtail is bland, but this time it was my favorite sashimi. The texture was almost like butter. It was that soft! I'd rank the yellowtail as my favorite, followed by white tuna, salmon, and tuna. The katsu don paired with the sashimi platter has decent portion sizes and just the right amount for dinner for 2. The katsu was a bit tougher than expected, but not too crusty because it was covered with egg. The rice had enough flavor and wasn't soaked in juices, certainly a plus. Sushi Tomi serves the best sashimi I've had in the states."
623,"Definitely $$, but WORTH IT. If possible, come for lunch because the portions and food quality are same as dinner, but at cheaper prices. I've never left here disappointed :) I love the sashimi here- it's buttery smooth and soo fresh. For sashimi lovers, I recommend the Seafood Salad (only $9 during dinner!) - comes with a nice amount of sashimi, and I love the touch of seaweed salad on top. The chirashi bowls are also amazing. They are a bit pricier ($20-30 during dinner), but generous amount of sashimi and seafood. The dinner combos ($18) are great for sharing! You get two entree choices. I've had both the chicken and beef teriyaki- they're okay. The chicken is a bit oily and comes with a lottt of chicken skin/fat. Expect to wait at least 10-15 minutes on a 'slower' weekday."
624,"Very best authentic but casual Japanese Sushi/Izakaya at Castro St, Mountain View. We always like to be there with family and/or friends."
625,"The sushi here is great. It's not melt-in-your-mouth quality, but it is clearly of better quality than most other sushi places. The fish is fresh and flavorful without being too seafood-y. I had no regrets about my Nigiri special - it was reasonably priced and each piece of fish was delicious.I only took away one star because of the service. To be fair, this place is very popular and very busy. However, the service does leave much to be desired. The restaurant layout is a little strange and has lots of pillars and nooks, so it can be hard to get a waiter's attention. It was hard to get water refills and even hard to get the check after we were done eating and had been sitting around for some time."
626,"Found this place on Yelp after browsing for good sushi places around Mountain View since I was in town and was craving sushi. I saw that they had good reviews, so I came here with a friend around 6pm for dinner. There was a little bit of a wait, but it wasn't bad. The place was packed with families. Our waitress was super nice and made sure our waters were constantly refilled. My friend and I ordered the Salmon Avocado Roll and the Spider Roll to share. The portions for the rolls were kind of small, but they were cheap, so I'm not complaining. We also ordered the miso soup, which I enjoyed, but I was very disappointed with the rolls. The fish wasn't very fresh and overall very underwhelming. I probably won't come back here and wouldn't recommend it to friends."
627,"MMMMMMM!!! SASHIMI LUNCH! SASHIMI CUTS SO THICK!Just writing this is making my mouth water so let's get to it before I ruin my keyboard.Ambiance:  This place is decent sized for Castro but because it's so yummy there will always be a wait at lunch.  Cool and casual, there is nothing to complain about (unless they can expand the place!)Service: My service was good even though the place was slammed.  I'm sure they're used to that level of traffic by now.Food: SASHIMI CUTS SO THICK! I ordered the sashimi lunch under recommendation of my waitress and boy am I glad I did!.  They were served at a perfect temperature and I was given a fairly large portion considering the cost of the lunch deal.  The star of the meal was the SALMON! The cut was so fatty the fish had an almost smoky flavor to it even though it was raw.  I can still taste it in my mouth just thinking about it.  I eat a lot of sushi and I've never had salmon so flavorful.  *shudders*What else can I say.  Will be back.  Will get salmon again.  Long wait, don't care."
628,"I've been here a handful of times - definitely good enough to warrant another visit. This place is a local favorite - if you come anytime near peak hours definitely expect to wait, but the service is prompt so you usually don't have to wait more than 20 minutes (perfect amount of time to head around the corner for boba at Tea Era!)Disclaimer: I was first introduced to sushi when I lived in Japan, so my standards are pretty high. One of the better, more reasonably priced sushi joints in the area with reasonably fresh fish, but nothing particularly spectacular. Unfortunately I'm rarely impressed by sushi in the Bay, so I just have to review based off of comparison. I typically get one of the nigiri sushi plates (the only way to properly eat sushi!) and an order of wakame salad even though I think it's overpriced ($4.90 for a tiny scoop!). The Special Nigiri Sushi includes all the typical nigiris, plus BBQ eel, ikura (salmon roe), and toro (fatty tuna). Perfect for a sushi fix."
629,"Pros: Great food, great variety, fairly good pricing, fast service Cons: Needs more seatingWould definitely return!"
630,This is a solid and authentic japanese restaurant nestled in mountain view. I don't think too highly of the South Bay in regards to sushi but sushi tomi really surprised me. Things to know:- Arrive upon opening time to avoid waiting in line otherwise come with patience as the lines can get long - Chirashi is really good. I love their rice.. It is some of the best in my opinion - Tomi special roll is an absolute must
631,Love the food there - a little pricy. Been doing take out there during the pandemic - too bad they didn't have an outdoor seating. Cant wait for re-opening.
632,"I was able to get a table here after an hour or so wait. Sushi Tomi seems to be a more traditional sushi place that focuses more on basic sashimi and rolls instead of the more complex rolls seen at other sushi places.We ordered the extra special sashimi plate and the regular chirashi bowl. In addition to staples like salmon and regular tuna, the extra special plate has sea snail, uni, ebi, toro, and amberjack. The regular chirashi bowl had more of the standard lineup of fish, but I imagine getting the extra special chirashi would be similar to the extra special sashimi plate. Overall, the fish was very fresh but the 1 hr+ waits (no option for reservation) and the slightly higher price point is something to consider. The wealth of sushi places in the area makes me feel like I could find another place with a shorter wait and lower price even if it is slightly worse in quality. Sushi Tomi is undoubtedly a quality sushi restaurant though and worth a try if you are willing to wait."
633,"Had to go with its famous Tomi roll. You get three choices of fish to go with the roll, but each has salmon and avocado with it inside. The rolls are pretty small but the flavors are delicous. Inside the restaurant there's not a lot of room but it's quite snug, cozy, and bustling in a positive way. :) There candies at the front reception stand are really yummy so grab a few on the wait out! One more note: there's probably going to be a line. We're got here past rush hour and still waited!"
634,My favorite sushi place in the Bay Area. Fresh ingredients and great staff. But come early since there is always a line.
635,"I worried we would waste 50 min of our youth waiting around for a table on a Saturday night at 8pm, and had already sketched out a backup plan that involved just-down-the-road Shalala Ramen or a-little-further-but-better Ramen Izakaya Yu-Gen. DELIGHTFULLY, I WAS WRONG. We were seated within 10 min! We ordered, for 3 people at $23 pp after tax+tip: 1 combination set with teriyaki salmon (4/5) and grilled mackerel (4.25/5); 1 beef tongue skewer (4/5); 1 unagi don (5/5), 1 california roll (4.5/5). With all that rice and the salad and miso soup (both of which deserve 4.5/5), it was just enough food to make me feel full without being saturated. In conclusion, I give my Asian vote to Sushitomi. It is more expensive than Yu-Gen, but it's also a different ball game; namely, the one that involves fresh fish variants and skewers. And they play it very well indeed."
636,"Based on a recommendation from a business associate, we decided to have a corporate dinner at Sushi Tomi on a recent Monday night.  Immediately after she said we should go to Sushi Tomi, I took to Yelp to prepare for what was in store for me.  My fellow Yelpers did not let me down one bit!  From the outside, it doesn't look like much - almost a bit sketchy actually.  But don't let that stop you, or you just may miss out on some of the best and freshest sushi outside of Japan!We walked in and lucked out that there wasn't a wait.  We were seated immediately in the main room where the sushi chefs were busy creating magic.  After perusing the 3 different menus (weird, I thought...but one was the main menu, the others were daily specials and the order form), we settled on the Tomi Special Roll w/ spicy tuna, Kampachi sushi, the Special Sashimi, and the miso soup.  I can't comment on the soup because only my dining partner-in-crime had that, but hot damn...everything else was melt-in-your-mouth PHENOMINAL!  We didn't even touch the complimentary edamame because we were saving all the gastronomical real estate for the real stuff.  As we were eating, we noticed that the place was starting to get packed.  By the time we were done, there were masses of people waiting outside.  To be perfectly honest, after having Sushi Tomi just this once, I can understand and appreciate their craze.  I'm going to be dreaming about this for quite some time now!"
637,yeah...... not what i expected. I remember folks working in the mountain view area saying this was a great place but I ordered the deluxe special chirashi bowl (probably got the name wrong) and the fish was very poor quality. Really large chunks of fish - not complaining about more fish but just wasn't sliced nicely - and mediocre quality. wouldn't go back
638,I am a big chirashi fan and I live in LA just traveled to San Jose. Searched for chirash and Sushi Tomi came to the first ranked. The fishes are so fresh that I don't think the la ones I've tried are better than them. Wish I could go there again to try other stuff.
639,"I'm not sure what all the hype is about. We ordered a rainbow roll and a spicy salmon roll, both of which were made hastily and devoid of any real flavor. I ordered some nigiri of squid, salmon roe, mackerel, Sweetwater shrimp. Typically the Sweetwater shrimp is served with the head fried whole. When it came out it was obvious that it had been frozen and then reheated. By looking at the sushi refrigerator you could tell that the fish had been there for sometime and although there was a lot of it, it was not super high-quality. I won't return here."
640,AMAZING sushi! Had to wait about 40 minutes but it was worth it. The fish is so fresh and flavorful. We ordered 7-8 roles and each was unique and delicious. I will keep coming for sure.
641,"Without exaggeration, the best sushi in Mountain View and surrounding cities. There is a reason why they always have a line while other places are nearly empty :)"
642,"They make really great everything here! I'm usually not that picky when it comes to eating sushi so when a place tastes that noticeably good, I think it says something about the quality of their food. The three of us shared a tempura udon, edamame, rainbow roll, caterpillar roll, Tomi special roll w/ hamachi, and 2 orders of uni nigiri. It is definitely on the pricier side. Our meal was $90. But, like I said, the seafood was really fresh. The special roll was particularly delicious - highly recommended! I usually don't like uni because I think it can taste like sea water. But this restaurant serves really good uni. Beware of the market price though! We didn't know each order was $13. Just those four pieces of uni nigiri was almost 1/3 of our meal cost.But since I don't usually order that, I'll be happy to come back again :)"
643,"Why this place is so popular remains a mystery to me. I can instantly name so many alternatives that are far superior...We came here on a Sunday for lunch, and waited quite a while to be seated. We had justifiably high expectations, but honestly its food didn't live up to the hype, and the price point is too high for the portion and the quality.I judge my Japanese place by its mackerel, so of course, I got a mackerel lunch special. I was underwhelmed. The fish was over salted and not grilled enough to render the fat. This is an instant turn-off for me, as an authentic japanese restaurant would know how to grill its mackerel to perfection like no others. Further, the fish was not offered as a whole, but in two awkwardly short chunky pieces. This is so far the least impressive mackerel I have had in the south bay. The pork tonkatsu was just okey, a bit over fried.Husband and friend got chirashi bowls. The sashimi/rice potion is really off. There was A LOT of rice yet very little fish. You can see half of the bowl is occupied by lettuce leaves! The fish selection does not live up to its price. For $28, you get 2 measly slices of tuna and 1 slice of salmon--and yet they are not even the good cuts--and lots of lettuce and meaningless fillers for the empty space. This is really disappointing.Some reviews suggest (without verification) that the fish was from Japan... So what? If it is not fatty, buttery, melting, and heavenly like it should be, do I really care if it is from Japan or Jamaica? Does the port of export really equate high quality? Me think not...Service is friendly but the entire time we felt rushed.So... overall I haven't warmed up to Sushi Tomi because of the poor value and the surprisingly unsatisfactory food. Back to Japantown..."
644,The sushi is amazing! This is the only place I come to when I'm in Mountain View! I normally get a specialty roll as well as vegetable tempura!
645,"I've never left a sushi establishment livid. They'll give you bad service but then come up to you and ask why you didn't leave a tip!!! Sashimi was just okay and uni wasn't super fresh. Full details: The audacity and shameless behavior of the service staff is shocking. I came in 15min before closing to eat at the bar. Asked if it was too late to have a quick bite and the hostess reassured me that it was fine and seated me. I ordered an omakase and the waiter brought sashimi instead of nigiri; not what I asked. I didn't complain and just ate even though I wasn't informed there would be more exotic things like abalone and squid I've never seen before. Not only did the waiter fail to communicate what I'd be getting he walked around snorting as if preparing to dislodge the contents barnacled in the back of his throat. Not very appetizing for sashimi!! While I was finishing the restaurant was still half full and the hostess asked me to pay the bill. I felt rushed especially since she had reassured me and I'd only been there for 20min, no joke. I did not leave a tip because I felt neglected, rushed and the hostess had the audacity to ask me why I didn't tip!!! After I expressed the reason and shock that she even asked she mumbled something about wanting feedback on the waiter. Extremely unprofessional!! Just a side note, if you're looking for authentic, this sushi place wasn't staffed with Japanese, who are too eloquent to offend you, it's staffed with Chinese. Never coming back."
646,"This review is for a few months ago. When we arrived to pick up our order, the staff person purposely ignored us. I think she was annoyed that we made her stay on the phone 15 secs longer than she wanted to so that we could sort out our order. We felt that it was petty and rude...It was the last time we went there."
647,"Sushi is on point, especially the sashimi.Overall good, but if it was a few bucks cheaper, I would've given this place 5 solid stars. Came on a Wednesday night at around 6pm, and the wait was around 15 minutes! Not sure how long the weekend would be...Ordered:Extra Special Sashimi: 4/5 fresh, deliciousTomi Special Roll: 4/5 delicious as well"
648,"Really enjoyed this spot in Mountain View. We've tried the Omakase twice, once sashimi style, once nigiri. Both times were were pleased with the cuts and variety of fresh fish. The arrangements are simple but the flavor of the fish accounts for making a very delicious dish. The extra special chirasi bowl is a great deal, similar selection of fresh cuts as the Omakase over a hot bed of rice. For appetizers, the hamach is fantastic, Hamachi collar is fantastic, takoyaki is delicious, and monkfish liver was a bit heavy. If you're very hungry show up right at 5p otherwise there is guaranteed to be a line but it's worth the wait."
649,"My favorite place to go for sashimi, hands down. They have another one in San Jose (it's the same but it's called Tomi Sushi instead) which I go to more often since it's closer to where I live, but I prefer this location slightly more. I always order their sashimi lunch, which comes with 3 slices of tuna, 3 yellowtail, 3 salmon, and 3 white tuna. Sometimes I also order their Sushi Tomi roll with hamachi... you gotta try it! Their sashimi is always fresh, but honestly sometimes they can be a bit sloppy on the slicing. There were times when I was given a plate of fish that didn't look like sliced sashimi, but rather, weird thick shapes that looked unappetizing (I had slices that looked like uneven pentagons and even cubes). But there are times where the slices are gorgeous... it's kind of inconsistent. Also, I'm a bit disappointed that they don't give out ginger anymore (I think they used to). The atmosphere is okkk, honestly not the best place for a romantic date or anything. It's tight and crowded and can get pretty loud. It's a small restaurant that gets a lot of business, so figures.But overall, I still like coming here and you should check it out if you haven't already!"
650,"It's hard to find a place that does sushi well. Yes, there are good Japanese places but doing sushi well isn't the same thing. I'm so glad I found this place. They have a good selection and and the fish is nice and fresh. There was a bit of a wait on a Sunday evening but it wasn't bad at all. The service was totally average but that's not what you're here for. I have to say they lose a point for having Blue Fin Tuna on the menu. Don't know why sushi places would still do that today.I'll definitely be back!"
651,"I came here for the first time a few months ago. Now I feel like I come here one every other week. Sometimes more. The sushi here is amazing!! So so fresh and their extra special chirashi bowl is the best value chirashi bowl in the area, imo. Comes with a generous amount of fish (lots of variety, including uni!) all for just $35. The wait times here can get long, but as long as you get here before 6pm you should be good. There's a parking lot right across the street, so super convenient if you get here early enough. And on a random side note, I love their hot tea!! :) Definitely my go to sushi place in the area."
652,"I came here for lunch and there was a huge line! It moved relatively fast. They have a couple daily lunch specials each day so I opted on option B which was a grilled fish with with a side of poke salad. The fish was was whole (with bones, scales) and had a nice char. The poke salad had seaweed and was very texturally interesting. The fish had very little meat on it (it was mostly bone and skin). The order came with a nice fish stew. I think the soup was the best part of the entire meal. The soup also had fish bones in it. The interior looks traditional Japanese (with square lines, light wood, and Japanese art. I also tried some donburi. It was simple/okay. Our service was prompt. I would love to come again and try more menu items."
653,"Was craving sushi and trusted the high reviews on Yelp.It was after work and I was starved. I came here wanting something super filling and satisfying but was kind of disappointed. Service took a bit of time, maybe each minute was further exaggerated by my hunger but I was getting kind of pissy. Then the food finally came and made everything better. I got the tomi special roll while the bf got the chirashi. I felt like all of the portions were kind of small or maybe I was just really hungry. The roll was nicely plated and came with a drizzle of sriracha mayo, which was a nice touch. The chirashi only came with 7 pieces of fish and a few pieces of other fillers. After devouring my roll, I was hungry enough to go down the street and devour a sandwich. Don't get me wrong, everything tasted great and was of good quality. I just felt like I spent a little much for barely putting a dent on my hunger pangs."
654,"I'm not from the area so when I asked my friends where their absolute go to place for sushi is and they highly recommended Sushi Tomi, of course I had to stop by! And boy,  I'm glad I did! I got the extra special nigiri lunch which usually comes with uni but they were out :( Still delicious though!The place is small and it's street parking but there is a meter lot right across from it! If you're going for lunch, I world say try to get there like 10 mins before opening and you won't have to wait long!"
655,"Quality has gone down so much since a few years ago. Food quality is bad.  Salad dressing was horrible, soup was really salty because it has nothing there but salt and water only."
656,"My go-to sushi place in the Mountain View area. The line-up is long but well worth it. Sushi rolls and meals are high quality and fresh, but there's one standout item on the menu: the ""surprise me"" omakase sushi. At $45 it's a bit on the pricey side but you get 10 pieces of nigiri chosen and crafted by chef himself. Not your usual run of the mill fish -- but simply the best and whatever is fresh and special for the day. It's a treat to sit at the bar and watch, as each piece is individually seasoned; no need to use extra soy sauce, just eat. Delicious!"
657,"I ate alooone... Yeaaaaaah with nobody eeeeeeelse. And it was amazing. I have never had better sushi and the secret was in the rice.  Order whatever you want, the rice will be in it and therefore be amazing. I had a yellow tail roll (simple and delicious), a bbq eel roll (rich and filling) and an order of tuna nigiri (melt in your mouth,  perfection). If only my stomach were larger,  i would have gladly stuffed more in."
658,"This is the only sushi place in the area we have found that serves excellent sushi, and also has great service. We ordered pretty basic rolls, Rainbow, spicy tuna, spicy salmon and California along with miso soup. The sushi was very fresh and tasted amazing. Our miso soup was really tasty as well and well balanced as far as saltiness, it also had a decent amount of seaweed and tofu.  Service was attentive, very kind and efficient. Price wise the basic rolls were decently priced, but the rest of the menu was quite pricey $15 and up. This was our first visit, and quite frankly I think this is the only sushi place we will be going too from now on. We have not had good luck finding a even subpar sushi place in the palo alto area. This place goes over and beyond on food quality and service! Definitely a must go!"
659,Bland tasting sushi rolls that are poorly crafted and fall apart easily. Edamame was soggy and disintegrates too. Long wait times.
660,"My go to place for reliably delicious sushi that won't break the bank.It's not going to be Michelin star quality sushi, but for a local sushi joint, it's pretty darn good. They have nigiri and sashimi dinner sets with different price points depending on the quality of fish you want, as well as your usual teriyaki and tempura meals, so there is something for everyone. Their nigiri dinners and chirashi bowls are my usual go to's, and you can get their regular up to their super deluxe, depending on how much you want to spend. During my last visit, the super deluxe nigiri came with a negihama roll (if you get their regular sushi dinner it comes with a California roll instead), as well as 8 pieces of nigiri (clam, shrimp, eel, uni, fatty tuna, salmon, snapper, and albacore tuna) and a fried sweet shrimp head, which was plenty of food. For those who like rolls, their Tomi Special roll has plenty of fresh fish, and is definitely more interesting than your usual caterpillar roll.It is a seriously popular place: I last went at 5pm (right when they opened) on a Sunday, and by the time we finished our meal, there was a huge crowd outside. I've even tried ordering via Doordash et al when I have a hankering at home, only to have my order rejected because the restaurant was too busy to fill it. So if you want to give this place a try, especially on a weekend, be sure to come early!"
661,came here on a Sunday - I can't believe how busy this place gets when they open at 5pm (got there 10 min after) - took the last seat at the bar - wait time for others was 1 hour (more or less) waiting timeMy friend recommend this delicious EEL BOWL - it was fresh and tasty. Also order Salmon Skin and some other roll i can't remember. it was tasty as wellCome here early if u want to get seats...
662,"Came for Sushi tonight with a friend and it was refreshingly light in terms of patrons.  Usually you have to wait but perhaps it was due to being a Weds night and we dined at 6 pm. Ambience - good.  More homestyle and not fancy at all.  Seats were clean and unobstructed. However the seats are a bit close so don't expect privacy.  Some of the patrons talk too loud and use their cellphones during dinner.  Not too polite. Service - very good.  Attentive, polite and efficient. Food - I had the chicken teriyaki and California roll.  Dinner comes with soup and salad.  The salad was fresh but the dressing was disgusting.  Just yucky taste.  Mayo with pickles!  Not to my liking. Price - reasonable for the area but not inexpensive.  I would say the total experience is a 3.5 stars. Enjoy!"
663,"A small, intimate and popular location. The food was delivered promptly, the sushi was clean, but the service and overall experience suffered on the night I was there. The sushi chefs were slammed and my waitress was in the weeds. A roll I ordered never made it to me, though I sat at the sushi bar. It did however make it to my bill, which was removed after the waitress verified I was never served.Based on other reviews, I am guessing I caught them on a bad night. I would try again as I am looking for a goto Sushi spot when in Palo Alto."
664,The only reason why we waited 45 mins to get a table was because of the yelp reviews. Boy oh boy was that a mistake. Probably the most disgusting sushi place I have ever tried. They messed up a simple side salad with a nasty mayo tasting salad dressing. The zaru soba had an awful fishy flavor and the rolls were poorly made. Each roll was falling apart and you could tell that the assembly was not professional. There were no descriptions of anything so we had to ask but the server was very unclear. We ended up with a bunch of rolls that weren't what we wanted because the menu was not clear or helpful. We were very disappointed...
665,"Come here for some yummy sushi.  This is the place to go if you want to have fresh fish and clean tastes.  This wouldn't be the place for the Japanese fusion with tons-of-sauce rolls and multiple-flavors-in-your-mouth restaurant.  However, if you want some good clean simple sushi/sashimi, this is the place for you.A good indicator is the chirashi bowl.  They have regular, special (with extra fish) and extra special (salmon roe & uni). This is the test to see if they have tasty fish.  What I like about this place is the temperature, consistency, and texture of the fish and rice.  The rice is almost room temperature and with the right about of seasoning, vinegar, etc.  The fish was prepared nicely and blended well with the rice.  The pieces in the bowl were of a generous size as well.  Please be warned, that it's a bit pricey, but still reasonable for sushi.  Also be prepared for a long wait even on a weeknight.  This would still be a place I come back to."
666,I visited Sushi Tomi for lunch recently based on previous reviews. I tried to stay out of lunch crowd hours to avoid parking/line issue. Asked about lunch special but it seems to be  always unavailable after 1:00 pm so if you want lunch special come early. I ordered Sushi Lunch and received 4 pieces of Nigiri and 6 pieces of maki (3 tuna/3 california). So here are my observations:Pros:* Miso soup (one of the best comparable to Sushi Sam's)* Rice (impressive and again comparable to Sushi Sam's)* California roll (while still likely crab imitation is very tasty)*Fish qualityCons:* Price $17 for sushi lunch is a bit pricey* Crowds and Parking is a pain* Decor (definitely no frills there)Verdict:I used to be a fan of Masa sushi that became casualty of  San Antonio grand construction project. The place had the pros above but no cons (cheaper and plenty of parking and never crowded). With Masa no longer around I will be coming to Sushi Tomi when I crave quality and don't want to drive to San Mateo. It is definitely not on my list for regular go to lunch places.
667,"What happened? I had fond memories of the fresh sashimi here so I returned.Ordered omakase x 2 & dragon roll, both underwhelming. Nobody told me the name of each nigiri. I asked a sushi chef and he identified the piece I was about to put in my mouth but not the rest. Granted they were busy, but c'mon..Omakase tasted a little off and nowhere as fresh as the first time. I saved my favorite for last hoping it will possess some redeeming qualities. Still, when I chomped down on the uni, an unusually bitter taste flooded my taste buds. Sadness.2.5 rounded up to 3 due to good service. I suggest getting there around 5~ if  you want to avoid the dinner rush. It's packed even on a Monday. Given the plethora of 5* sushi joints in my vicinity, you won't find me here."
668,"Drove out to MV from Pacifica to try this place and I'm glad I did! We didn't have to wait since I like sitting at the bar and watching the sushi chefs work their magic, so that was nice :) This place is P0PPIN' though, so come early if you want a table.sashimi: 5/5 very thick & generous cuts, so fresh! :) hamachi & tuna were my favorites.nigiri: 4/5 yuum. wasn't a fan of the spicy tuna though, I just can't do spicy fish.caterpillar & spider roll: 5/5 damn good rolls! delicious and very nicely arranged, I was so sad that I forgot to take a picture haha.service: 3/5 waitress could have been less rude-she was very irritated when I wasn't ready to order. the sushi chefs were friendly though!Funny watching my friend fumble with his chopsticks, too much pride to ask for a fork like the people next to us :PCome here if you want legit Japanese food. But make reservations."
669,"I went to here for lunch today. I ordered two items combo ""Saba shio and beef teriyaki "" and my friend ordered Sashimi lunch.Both come with miso soup, rice and salad.We were very happy today , because servers were very friendly and hospitality, foods were very tasty too. We are both from Japan, so we know Japanese foods.If I live near by sushi Tomi, I want to eat every day. But I'm sure will be back soon!ここはサーバーの皆さんがとっても感じよくって料理も美味しく頂きました。サバ塩の塩加減が実に良かった！"
670,"Couple of my friends, who had never had sushi, wanted to try sushi. After a lot of research we decided on Tomi sushi and it proved to be just perfect. The place is usually super crowded for dinner, and we were going on Friday evening, so i stopped by early to put our name in the wait list. We came back an hour later and we got our table quickly. The food was amazing. Their Tomi special with spicy tuna was the best. Will definitely go there again, soon."
671,"I am not really sure why this place is not 5/5. The sushi is top notch. We've lived in a  few cities and eaten at a LOT of sushi places. This place is really fn good. Get the tomi speciality roll, it tastes like fresh meat over campfire. If you appreciate fresh meat and fish, this is your spot."
672,"Sushi Tomi is simply the best sushi place in town!! I hesitate to share as the place is already exploding with patrons, but they really have their to-go system down, which makes me willing to share this gem.It is fresh, nicely cut, friendly staff. Would recommend 5/5"
673,"Best sushi Ive had in a long time. My husband and I split the chef's special and added a few extra rolls and sushi. The chef's special came with three different appetizers and they were all outstanding. We both liked the broiled fish the best, it was outstanding and not something we normally order. The rest of the order was also very good. The fish was super fresh and good quality. Only downside is the place is kinda small, so there was a bit of a wait. Overall, very worth it. We will be back."
674,"Discovered this place when my friends and I had a fail attempt to go to Crepevine in downtown Mountain View earlier to have some late lunch. So I've searched for other places that had at least 4 yelp stars with lots of reviews and found Sushi Tomi. We parked where the nearby garage is at so it was a bit far but we didn't mind the walk since it was a nice stroll along downtown. I got to the bento box - chicken teriyaki, saba, sashimi and tempura. It was delicious. I never really had an idea what the hell saba was until my food arrived; it was just a grilled fish and you put some lemon and salt if you wish or just eat it without it. I had three huge pieces Tuna sashimi and I was surprised how thick the cut was. Usually, sushi places will serve you about 4-5 sashimi pieces but they area tiny portion.Service was good as well. Our waitress checked up on us from time to time to see if we needed something else - mostly refill of water and extra napkins. This is definitely my go-to spot in downtown Mountain View if I want something affordable and yummy!"
675,"Very high quality sushi at a reasonable price, especially considering the quality - I'm used to getting less food and less quality sushi most of the time, often paying more. Service was prompt as well. It does get a bit crowded, but with good reason.I came here last Saturday night, arriving around 6pm, as my friend who had been before advised us that it gets busy. We waited for about 5 minutes for a table of 3, not bad at all. Though there was a longer line upon leaving.They had a few special fish of the day, flown in from Tsukiji market (arguably the most premium sushi market in the world!) in Tokyo. We ended up sharing among the 3 of us:- 2 orders of the Chef's sashimi omakase- 1 order of the special Squid sashimi (from Tsukiji)- 1 order of the special Octopus sashimi (from Tsukiji)- 1 order of Salmon sashimi- 1 eggplant appetizer (I expected nasu dengaku - miso glazed eggplant, but this was a bit different, with bonito flakes, and very little to no glaze. Not as soft and smooth, but very nice).- 1 spinach and sesame seed appetizer (fairly sugary, but very tasty)- 1 each of the plum and salmon onigiri among my 2 friends- complimentary miso soup for each of us (yum! almost ordered this and was so happy to see it come)The squid and octopus were chewy as usual, and my friends were not a huge fan of this, but that's a matter of their taste, and they admitted they were trying it out. I was in love though. The omakase included abalone, thai red snapper, tuna (lean, medium, and fatty), amberjack, and 2 kinds of white fish. Great selection, and especially I'll note that the lean tuna was where I was sure this was high quality fish, as it had that less strong/fishy taste that the fresh tuna does, which is a rarity. Absolutely delicious. The salmon as well was even soft and smooth enough that it fell apart at the fat lines, which was new to me. Other than my friends being less happy with the nature of the squid and octopus, and none of us turning out to be big Abalone fans, everything was very well-received. And despite this being a feast of very high quality sashimi, which can get VERY expensive, it came out to $60/head, which I think is very reasonable for what we got.Will happily return, though probably try to come on the early side again."
676,"We've been here a million times for lunch, and the sushi lunch, tempura, hot tea, the soup, the salad, never get old. Best sushi I've had in the bay area."
677,"Tried the all salmon sashimi lunch on a friend's advice, was wonderful. The hot tea is great, the gyoza is excellent too."
678,"Amazing sushi and the quality is always reliable. I got the Omakase ($45) which was worth the splurge for a celebratory dinner. Each bite is perfectly crafted and unique with the daily special fresh ingredients. They currently also have an Omakase special for $70 that comes with appetizers including poke, fish liver, and tiny fried octupus. Delish!!!"
679,Excellent sushi and great services! Many good variety of dishes to choose from.One of the best Sushi restaurants in the area.
680,I waited in line among many others assuming this place would be good only to have paid $70 for sushi that was not fresh nor tasty. The rice to fish ratio was so bad (more rice than fish) and I immediately broke out in hives because of the lack of freshness.
681,"This place serves solid sushi.  Fish was fresh and cuts were large.  Toro was steep at $75 bucks for about six pieces if I recall correctly but besides the high price for that, the rest was priced as expected.  Even at $75 bucks, the quality was worth it.  This place rivals the best of the bay including Kenji, Amakara, and Sen Dai.Drawback is it is packed.  Got there at 11:40am"
682,I'm my opinion his and bushido are the only Japanese restaurants on Castro worth my cash.Tomi is on the pricey side for dinner but for lunch it's actually quite normal prices on their lunch specials. The service is great but they do get busy so prepare to wait or get there early. The have one of the best sushi bars around.
683,"Fresh fish; very popular, space is small and crowded, long waiting all the time :(The service is just so-so, I didn't get chance to talk too much with the servers, very busy serving.So besides the good fish, everything else is just so-so, no idea why it's so popular."
684,"Very very Fresh fish; very popular, could get long lines waiting, space is very crowded, spaces between tables are limited; their table is short, chair is not.A lot of Unagi in unagi don, but no other ingredients besides unagi n rice, I was expecting seaweeds or some other things, tasty, but not balanced nutritionally."
685,"Probably my favorite place to get sushi in MV. It's consistently good, portions are decent, and fish is fresh. It gets packed so make sure you beat the dinner/lunch crowd or you're waiting. I highly recommend getting their sushi plates or their lunch/dinner combos. This place isn't too big on rolls so there's not a lot of options. I love their nigiri combos because it's the perfect amount of food and the fish is fresh and tasty! Their chirashi bowls also look good but that tends to be too much rice for me. Their lunch/dinner combos are actually pretty filling. I usually get the chicken terriyaki in combination with sashimi or spicy tuna roll. Their chicken is grilled just how I like it, which is to the point you can taste that charred/seared portion of the chicken and they don't go super heavy on the sauce which is nice! Their prices are a higher than other sushi restaurants in the area but worth it if you're a fan of quality fish."
686,Love this place!  Love the taste and quality of the dishes of this place.  The best Japanese Restaurant in Bay area for the price so far.
687,"I had a poor experience here despite previous experiences that had been okay. First and foremost, if you have any allergies, I would avoid this place, because apparently they don't know what they are serving. The service was lackluster (no smiles- like they are anti-smiles!), the food was very mediocre, and the prices are way too high in comparison with the portions. I've had better sushi elsewhere and I grew up eating it, and in different styles when I lived in Japan.What concerned me most is that the person I came with suffered an allergic reaction while eating the food that was served, so after a few bites, she immediately had to stop eating. I promptly asked the server if they have any nuts/allergens in their food or cross contamination that could occur. I informed her that my guest was suffering from an allergic reaction and luckily she was able to notice it before it got any worse. The server couldn't answer the questions, didn't bother to check on all the food ingredients, and didn't seem to care that my guest was having an allergic reaction, nor did she think that it was her problem. She didn't have the slightest look of concern either. She basically pushed us out the door having paid the bill.I was and am astounded. The attitude a business has towards a customer's health and safety must represent the true value of how much they care about the service and food they provide as well. Please reconsider before visiting a business which treats its customers' well being with such neglect and indifference. They're just collecting their dollar bills and shoving you out as soon as they can."
688,Best sushi in the area! I recommend ordering right when they open around 5pm otherwise it gets very busy.
689,"This place reminded me of Kome buffet in Daly City. Essentially, Tomi has your basic Asian food cuisine ranging from Chinese roasted meat, dim sum to Japanese sushi with decent fresh seafood. However, our server who also seemed like a supervisor could've treated our big group of 24 people with more respect. We had at least 75% from our group who qualified as seniors and one of them had a walker. After he sat down, our server didn't even assist in helping us store the walker so that it wouldn't block the narrow walkways. I had to ask another server to assist. Overall, other servers were satisfactory but just not ours. Food quality is decent."
690,"No ambiance, sitting at sushi counter was ignored by sushi man.Waitress who speaks with a thick Chinese accent seems impatient and abrupt.Main dish dinner was served on an oval plastic Chinese plate...My deluxe sashimi dinner didn't come with anything ... maguro had a lot of tendon in it, no presentation nor flair.... Extremely bad!  I travel extensively, been to do many Japanese restaurants and sushi bars, don't waste your money on this one"
691,Love this place! Really enjoy their wide selection of sashimi. It's been one of our go-tos during COVID.
692,"This is one of the best spots in mountain view area  It's a cozy small place so it gets pretty packed but the wait is never too bad.  Lunch hours are pretty crazy here, so order out if you want it to be quick. Authentic & fresh food every time, fun place."
693,"The wait is crazy here FYI, but I would say it was worth it! :) Chef's Choice Sashimi--The lean tuna and salmon cuts tasted very fresh and the texture was great! I tried Amber Jack for the first time and although it had too strong of a fishy taste, I enjoyed the moderately fatty texture. The toro wasn't my cup of tea but it was fresh nonetheless. I did not like the taste of the Uni and probably will never eat that again (once again my preference and not the way it was prepared). I had the hardest time eating the sea snails because it reminds me of the times I killed snails in my backyard. Anyhow, I like the texture more than the taste or the thought of eating snails. The white fish's texture was in between a crunchy and jelly consistency, which I didn't quite like. The flavor of the fish I didn't particularly enjoy either. I thought overall I experienced a lot of raw seafood and also got to eat fresh, delicious standard cuts like tuna and salmon. Extra Special Chirashi-This had some of the standard sashimi cuts including tuna and salmon. The seaweed and mushrooms on the side were a great addition! The egg was a bit too sweet! The rice was chewy and not too sticky. Yay!I am giving this place a four star because the seafood is very fresh. I would love to come back to try some of the fun appetizers though!"
694,order the 6 kinds of  sushimi for $28 and a lunch special plus 2 order of nigili.i just want to say the 6 kinds of sushimi is totally not worth it for $28the sushimi provided was just a left over skin with small chunk of meat and i am shock when i see that kind of quality of the fish that offer to customer!be careful with what the special offer for the day!
695,"The cooked food is FANTASTIC, raw food is good.Fast service, fresh seafood, DELICIOUS cooked dishes (especially the teriyaki and tempura), and a wonderful house roll. However, you'll be waiting awhile unless you get there early, and they don't take reservations. Service isn't the most professional but is still swift and attentive."
696,"Fresh fish, mediocre rolls, and misleading prices on Yelp. Mixed don was $20 on the manu but shows $16 on Yelp. There is a price difference of at least $3 for everything. I'd suggest update your Yelp page please."
697,"Ordered the sashimi dinner.  It was excellent.  Nice size pieces of maguro tuna, sake salmon, hamachi yellow tail and Shiro albacore tuna.  Priced in the ~25 range.  Comes w edamame, miso soup, rice and a bowl of salad.  I'm in heaven.  Been eating sushi for two weeks in Hawaii and here I am again.  The flavor and freshness is as good as it gets."
698,"The best sushi in Mountain View / Palo Alto, and probably the highest quality sushi you can get in the medium price point.Get:- Sushi Tomi special with yellowtail- Chirashi lunch special (if they it)- Tempura- Omasake optionsWhen to go:- Weekday lunch, right when they open- Weekend lunch (anytime, they're no busy)- Dinner after 8pm or before 6:15. If you go 6:15-8pm, you'll wait a long time. There is virtually no wait other timesIt's moderately priced. You can eat for $15-$20 pp comfortably. If you want good, non snobby sushi with fresh fish, this is the place to go"
699,I love my favorite local sushi  spot. Perfect for date night or just a solo night at home! It's always so fresh and delicious! A diamond in the rough :$
700,"We got hamachi and tuna nigiri, as well as various mixed rolls (e.g. catepillar, spider). Most items were pretty well done and a fair amount. I would not recommend the spider roll because the pieces are too big and too big to eat. Before the meal, there is free edamame and miso soup, which is a plus. There is a long line and wait, especially during dinner time (estimate 30 minutes for a table of 4).Overall, good sushi place but a bit pricey."
701,"I feel like the sushi has gotten even better since they've switched to take-out only for the Coronavirus stay-at-home order. Considering the controls they have in place, I feel safer ordering from them than I did at several other restaurants that have switched to take-out only. Highly recommended delicious sushi, especially in this dark time of take-out only!"
702,"Zero stars isnt an option. Soo. I jus returned home fr lunch at Sushi Tomi. I arrived hella early w my ten month old bc I didn't want her waiting in line in the cold. So we pulled up to a parking space literally parallel to the front door. We sat in the back seat w the door open so the lady would know we were first and waiting. She saw me and avoided eye contact several times and put the closed sign on so I could see it. Thats fine, we continued to wait and watch Elmo videos. At around 11:20, ten mins before they officially open, a young white guy shows up by himself. The lady, who saw me alone w my baby, rushed out to let him inside. All of the sudden, they're not closed anymore. GOD FORBID A WHITE MALE IS WAITING FOR MORE THAN 30 SECONDS OUT IN THE COLD. After that, she still didnt gesture towards me. So, finally, I closed the car door and walked up to her. She opened the door and said, ""How many?"" I said, ""I know you saw me and my baby waiting since 11am."" She said, ""Ok, how many?"" Some minorities are so immersed and numb to white privilege that they become one of the reasons for its health and longevity. I sit down, order, and wait. I am served hot tea ONCE, other tables are refilled and liquored up multiple times. There's bones in my nigiri. They want to charge me $5 for a slice of avocado for my baby to eat.  No one checks on my table again after my food is served.  Other (anglo) tables are offered ""off the menu specials"" and greeted with a smile and hug. Really appalling behavior all around. I had been coming here since 2013, and will never be back. If you're looking for amazingly fresh, reasonably priced sushi served with a caring smile... go to Sushi Sam's Edomata in San Mateo. It is lifetimes better in every which way.PS -- Their health score is 66/100! Do you want salmonella?"
703,They currently offer pickup bento boxes for lunch and dinner. Variety kinds of sides as well. Very helpful in this dynamic COVID-19 situation.
704,"4 Stars and about 1,300 reviews, I had some high hopes for this place. Me and my friend arrived on Wednesday night around 8:45pm (about 45 minutes before it would close) and ended up being seated at the sushi bar. No problem, I love watching the sushi chefs do their thing.Our server quickly asked us what we'd like to drink; simple, glass of water please. After that, we still haven't decided what we wanted to order. By the way, they have like 3 menus: 1) checklist of nigiri / handrolls / etc 2) dinner sets / kids menu / etc 3) Some printed excel sheet with more fish choices. Eventually we decide to order from the checklist and hand it to our server. Before she left, she makes sure to tell us that they're having last call and we would have to order more now, but we passed on that. Several minutes later, she comes back to tell us that they did not have any Tai that day and we should select something else. Okay, understandable, but again, she told us that they were having last call... Granted, I did eat dinner before coming here, I figured that a few pieces of nigiri would still taste good. Our orders are soon placed in front of us by the sushi chef (at different intervals) and we begin chowing down. Sadly, the nigiri didn't hold together very well and the fish had a strange ""hard"" texture which was odd because the fish itself was delicious to me. As we continue eating, small groups are being seated around us (weird, I thought they were doing last call). Funny thing, our server comes back and asks if we wanted to order more. Normally, I wouldn't mind the updates, but the constant rush to put our orders in was starting to get ridiculous if you're planning to seat new customers (it's about 9:30pm by now).The only redeeming factors were definitely the sushi chefs (I eavesdropped on an order of omakase and the chef was super polite and accommodating). Oh, and the chefs also gave us a complimentary dish of salmon bone (I think). All-in-all, Sushi Tomi is a pretty expensive sushi restaurant with subpar service (from the wait staff) and decent fish. I'd recommend going elsewhere unless you're ordering the omakase."
705,"The fish tasted high quality, but personally I didn't really like this restaurant that much. Their selection was quite small and it was mostly ordinary sushi / nigiri dishes. If you're the type of person that likes ""colorful"" sushi with a lot of ingredients / sauces, you'd be disappointed here. The service was great but prices wise, everything is quite expensive."
706,"I love coming here when i'm in the area. They have great options such as tonkatsu (my favorite so far- so crispy and good), salmon teriyaki, sashimi, and gyoza for their lunch special. The service during the lunch hour is always very quick and polite. I'm definitely coming back here for lunch."
707,"I was craving sushi one night for dinner and found this place on Yelp. I'm surprised I haven't heard of this place!On a Saturday night the wait for two was 30-40 mins. We didn't get a table however, but we were fine sitting at the sushi bar.I love chirashi and after seeing all the pictures on Yelp, I knew I had to order it. What we ordered: uni shooters, an order of sake toro, hamachi toro, and white tuna nigiri, an unagi don, an extra special chirashi, and the tomi special roll. We also ordered the ankimo (monkfish liver) appetizer, but it never came. We were honestly so full from the food that I was a bit grateful they forgot our ankimo. Our dinner also came with complimentary bowls of miso soup. We also received a complimentary side salad which I think came with the unagi don.The sushi was delicious. The sake toro was definitely very memorable and a must try. The salmon belly was very buttery with fat marbled nicely, tender and just delicious. I'll definitely have to order more of it next time. The other fish were all very fresh and delicious too. The extra special chirashi was amazing as well with a great selection of sashimi. Their uni was also very good, wasn't grainy at all. I think I prefer the uni nigiri over the uni shooters, but that's just my personal preference. I definitely have to try their ankimo next time.Their prices are on the pricier side for sushi, but it's definitely worth it. Our bill came out to be around $123.Service was pretty good. Waitresses are attentive and speedy. However, when I told the waitress that we didn't get the ankimo, she had to confirm with the sushi chefs and the sushi chef told her ""if they say they didn't get it then they didn't get it, just write it off"". I mean this conversation happened in front of us. I found it a bit rude, especially since they sounded like they didn't believe us. I would have still requested it if I was still hungry. But that scene was just baffling.Overall, 4 stars for their sushi, but 2 stars for their service."
708,"Best value in Palo Alto vicinity. The fish is always excellent , and the service great. Quite busy at lunch though."
709,"The line is long, and you think ""this place must be great.""  But, alas, you are wrong.The place is underwhelming.  Edamame is free, but stale.  You can get better at Costco.We ordered Sashimi special, sake toro, scallops, salmon roe, and uni.  Miso soup.  Green tea and Sapporo.    The only thing we liked were the scallops, miso, and tea/beer.  The rest was tough, dry, and dull.  One would expect better sushi at  your local supermarket.I'm willing to give it another shot, if others in my party desire it.  But, honestly, given the higher cost/price, I'd go somewhere else."
710,I can understand why this place is so popular. They have tasty rolls and really fresh fish. The interior design and overall dining environment is very pleasant as well! We got their sashimi and sushi platter as well as a lunch special. Very large portions. My gosh the salmon sashimi was so flavorful and sweet. Their Tomi roll was yummy too. Highly recommend coming early if you're here for a weekend lunch. We arrived at 11AM on a Sunday and barely beat the crowd.
711,"Sushi is very basic. Reminds me of Safeway sushi cept you're paying 5x the price at tomi. The tonkatsu was so dry I had to drench it in sauce. I have pretty low standards for food so if I say something is bad, its BAD. I'm just dissapointed. The 4 star 2k reviews baited me. REEEEE"
712,"This is a really good Japanese restaurant, and I have been going here for many years. However, recently I have noticed that the quality of their food isn't quite the same as it was before - it is still good, just not the way it was before. It is also not as crowded as it was before, although if you come on the weekends there can still be a queue to get in."
713,"The struggle is real ... when it comes to wait time at Tomi! We got a friend who said we have to visit this place if we were in Mountain View. And what an excellent recommendation! We came near peak dinner time so we had to wait. The foods we saw on the tables while we were waiting were all very beautifully presented but small, almost like tapa style. Some of the sashimi platter was divine!By the time we got sat, we had already had our order. The waiter took our order, brought us something to drink while we waited and we enjoyed a nice conversation while waiting. Sakes were nice, too. I do not like mine warm; I like higher-priced chilled sake (light on the rice polishing, thank you)! We ordered a lot of dishes; we were on feasting mode and everything we ordered was very fresh and delicious. Our waiter also kept checking on us! But the place is really small, so expect to feel slightly cramped. I thought the vibe was very nice and, in spite of the tiny space, Tomi had a modern, sleek and friendly feel to it.If the place was larger and took reservations, Tomi would get 5 stars. But, until that happens, it will still get a good Yelp review from me! I highly recommend this place for a fun dinner or a special occasion. You might come extra early to cut down on the wait time! Really solid place!"
714,"Overall best sushi in mountain view Castro St.! Super reasonable pricing for quality and legit tasting authentic Japanese food. All sushi chefs appear to be from Japan. Staff is attentive even though the lunch rush is epic! Get there early as tables fill endlessly and a line and wait surely will await for you! Some memorable moments include: hamachi toro, toro, and uni all imported and on point especially in price!"
715,The special roll (hamachi) was super delicious but hamachi sushi(toro) was so so. I will definitely come back for their special roll.
716,"Very impressive. Ordered Extra Special Chirashi, super super fresh tuna, uni etc. Totally worth it! Will definitely come back!"
717,Best sushi in the bay area! Highly recommend the Tomi Special Roll with  Hamachi coupled with a deep fried soft shell crab.
718,"Small restaurant with only street metered parking or the public lot across the street. They don't take reservations even if you have a large party so I highly suggest not to come with a party larger than 4. Go earlier if you're meeting people because there will be a wait. I came with a group of six and was quoted 20 mins when we walked in around 7:45PM on a Sunday but it ended up being closer to 40 min.My order:Extra Special Chirashi: $29What makes the chirashi ""extra"" special is the addition of Uni and Toro to the Special Chirashi. The slices of sashimi were fresh, firm and fairly decently sized.Since we were seated so late, we think they had extra stuff in the kitchen because even after the kitchen was closed a plate of fried shrimp heads were sent out complimentary to us. Flavorful and crispy, they were fairly good (it was free anyways so no real complaints)A bit on the pricier side (typical for Mountain View though) but good fish for the area. Not a have-to-go-back-to again but wouldn't mind either."
719,"I am really digging this sushi joint. A lot of new sushi joints are all about fancy rolls or LED lights/decor and I like how simple Sushi Tomi is. The focus is on fresh fish and just simple sushi .I really enjoyed the amaebi (sweet shrimp), uni (sea urchin) and hamachi (yellowtail). I thought that the sashimi was fresh and the 5 of us ate plenty of sashimi, but the bill was only ~$34 with tip!"
720,"I really liked the sushi here. However, I docked a star because of the long wait- my friend and I waited for 45 minutes for a seat Friday around 8PM. When you walk in, you immediately see the sushi bar seating in front of the very pro sushi chefs, who are busy prepping for meals and slicing the fish in the oh-so-fine way. There are seats at the bar, as well as a some in the adjacent room. The space is very limited. Just walking through to our seats, we had trouble maneuvering past the chairs and tables. There were wooden booths/benches on the wall, but we were seated right next to the kitchen, which was distracting. The waiter was prompt to give us tea and take our order, but they ran out of specific items, like the gyoza.We ordered the agedashi tofu, tomi roll, spicy tuna roll, and unagi don. I really enjoyed the tomi roll, the raw fish tasted fresh and fatty, and it worked nicely with the avocado.  The  sauce had a kick to it and the thinly sliced red raw onions added another dimension to the roll. I've never had a roll prepared like this before. Really interesting. The spicy tuna roll was good. It had a higher salt content than I would have like, but the ""spicy"" flavor was definitely there. I was disappointed with the agedashi tofu, because I've had a lot better, the tempura skin seemed to kind of melt off TOO easily. The unagi don was not good. The unagi was overcooked and too chewy. Service was good and prompt."
721,One of the best Sushi places in the South Bay. I'm always impressed with quality and service.
722,"I always take my friends to this place whenever they're in town and they always love it!  The sushi here is by far the best I've had in south bay.The service is fast and the wait is actually not that bad (I usually only come here with 2 people though, when I come with 3+ sometimes I have to wait an hour).  The waiters are friendly and prompt and also their green tea is a must to start off!One small con that I've noticed is that in the past few months I've been coming here, for some reason I'll be asked twice by different waiters what I would like to drink when I sit down.  And I'll have to tell the second waiter that I've already been helped.  Also sometimes when I first sit down to catch up with a friend they rush over and ask if we're ready when I haven't even had the menu for 30 seconds."
723,"This place continues to serve outstanding sushi and sashimi with wonderful consistency. It's massively popular, even on a rainy weekday at lunch. They're very honorable about their waitlist, but expect a 20-25 minutes wait, at a minimum, unless you arrive within 15 minutes of the lunch or dinner opening time. Also, they will NOT seat a group if there are members of the party who aren't there yet. The hamachi, ikura, and saba are some of my favorites here. The chirashi is pretty good, as are the udon options. They almost always have a delightful salmon Kama or hamachi kama, too."
724,"There are quite a few sushi restaurants in the vicinity of Sunnyvale and Mtn View but Sushi Tomi is hands down the most consistent. I've been about 6 times a year, at least, for the last 5 years and I've never been disappointed. I almost always have sushi and sashimi when here, because their fish is ALWAYS wonderfully fresh and delicious. In addition to serving some unusual fish from different regions in Japan, their ikura, hamachi, saba, and toro are great, whether served as sashimi, nigiri, temaki, or maki--you can't go wrong however you order it riends have ordered other menu items and I've tasted most--including their tempura, gyoza, bento box lunches, teriyaki, etc. These aren't my favorite foods so I'm not the best person to critique them but my friends and family who have ordered them are enthusiastic about the food. The udons are quite good, however, with very flavorful broths and great noodles, and some of the appetizers, such as the salmon kama, are great. Sometimes the service is not the ""most"" friendly, but still the servers are attentive to requests. They get very crowded during the middle of their lunch and dinner hours, so coming early or late makes it easier to get a table quickly. There is no waiting area inside, and it can get chilly waiting outside the restaurant for your table. Once inside, you forget all about that, though, as you warm up with tea or sake and good food."
725,"Great dinner! I came alone and had to wait a while, but it was worth the wait. I sat at the bar and the chef surprised me with some great nigiri, and the Tomi roll was excellent."
726,"Was skeptical of the location off Castro street, the curb appeal, and the prices, but Sushi Tomi not only lives up to, but exceeds its high marks.- Small and popular. No reservations. Write your name on a clip board, count number of names before you, multiply by 5, and that is your minute wait time.(note this formula works for all restaurants e.g. 2 names = 10 minutes, 4 names = 20 minutes). - Seaweed salad was fresh and not overly dressed. - California rolls were incredible. Rich, freshly mixed crab.- Spider roll's soft shell crab was perfectly fried.- Super bomb roll was meh. Warm sushi never rubs me the right way.Can't wait to come back and try some teriyaki, katsu, and sashimi!2 specialty rolls, 2 california rolls, seawood salad, one soft drink = $49.00"
727,Hubby and I only come here for the Chirashi. Great quality Chirashi for the price. Friendly and great service. Just be aware of the long queue to get inside. But I guarantee the delicious food is worth the wait.
728,"After moving from San Jose to Sunnyvale, I had to look for another sushi joint as Cha Cha Sushi (my fave sushi restaurant) was just too far. After browsing through yelp, trying some sushi places nearby, I finally found this gem. Every time I go it's always busy and there's always a wait. Even at 8pm! I still think it's worth the wait though as I've never had to wait longer than 30 mins. The workers here are very nice. The place is pretty small and the decor is just okay.  I've tried a few nigiris, rolls, hand rolls, and all were pretty good. The sashimi was very fresh but the size varies. The first time I went they ran out of oysters, but the second time I was able to order some.. boy were they delicious! Very fresh and tasty. This isn't the best sushi joint I've been to, but it is the best I've found in this area so far. Will be coming back :-)"
729,High quality sashimi for a good price! We came here for lunch and had the regular sashimi and regular chirashi sushi. The fish was melt-in-your-mouth delicious... definitely coming back!
730,Definitely one of the best sushi we've ever had. Worth the wait ! The tomi special roll is a must have !
731,"The good: very good quality fish for Sashimi.What could be improved: my sushi roll wasn't the prettiest I've had, but again, the fish was super fresh so it tasted great.Pricing is a bit strange. An awesome Sushimi plate $16 while salmon roll $7, which I found a bit overpriced.Menu seemed a bit limited but it had most of the typical stuff. Didn't get a good explanation on what was in the Chirashi ball but it was $20 so I passed. Can't compare to the places in Seattle where we pay under $16 for Chirashi ball with 16 pieces of super fresh sashimi."
732,"The sashimi caused me and my husband diarrhea, period.Ok the system insists that I have to write more in order to post as a review. We had dinner there. The service is fine, tempura is fine, sashimi was not put on the ice when serving, which surprised me at the first. My husband started running to bathroom about three hours after the dinner. My symptoms started at midnight about 2am. Horrible!"
733,I'm truly shocked this place has positive reviews! I tried several items and they were all terrible. The tempura was flavorless. The soba was super fishy. I've gotten a better California roll at a supermarket. And the chicken teriyaki was fatty and bland. Plus the prices are steep! I would never return and would never recommend this place to anyone. Truly one of the worst Japanese style meals I've ever had!!!
734,More like 3.5 stars but closer to a 3 than a 4I came on a Saturday for lunch and it wasn't too crowded. We got seated just 5 minutes after putting our names down. The service is a bit subpar but really can't expect too much. I ordered a sushi lunch and the sashimi was pretty good and cut well (against and not along the grain). I think the presentation could have been a lot better because it honestly looked a bit sloppy. The rolls I got were not consistent in size and were all different; this made the rice/filling ratio a bit off. Consistency is really important in Japanese cuisine so slightly disappointed in that area but overall a decent place
735,"Best sushi ever in Mountain View, brilliant costume service, reasonable prices, and delicious sushi"
736,"Sushi: 3.5/4 stars Service: 5 starsThe sushi I have here is usually really good. Last visit was just ok . The service has been consistently good. If I go here by myself, I am seated quickly, and am able to order quickly. If you make eye contact with any of the workers (whether they are serving, seating people, or making sushi), they will immediately ask if you need anything! A heads up for larger parties: there is always a wait. Smaller parties seem to get seated faster. Everyone in the party MUST be there if you want to be seated."
737,"Sushi and sashimi were pretty good.  The rolls were more than adequate.  But the tempura was subpar due to the fact that the batter was very uneven and not crisp.  It seems like they just dropped the whole shrimp in the oil and not ""swirl"" the tempura before dropping it in.  Also the batter was not at the right temperature when cooking and the shrimp was not prepared correctly.  The chicken karage were fried chicken wings and the waiter who was serving us said that it was served 2 ways the other was boneless which most Japanese restaurants I have been to served it that way; the waiter failed make this distinction until the chicken wings were served.I started coming to this place back in the late 80's when the owner was a mother and daughter and they wore kimonos during the dinner service.  Even then it was pretty busy."
738,"Finally came to try out Sushi Tomi, which is always crowded during lunch and especially dinner rush!We ordered a lunch bento box and several nigiri. The bento was really a good deal, the sashimi came with it were very thick. Sabashioyaki from the bento was one of the best I've had! The nigiris were okay. I think next time I am tempted to try the chirashi!"
739,"This restaurant is to be easily regarded as one of the best sushi restaurants in the bay area. The downsides are that wait times can be quite long, parking is often painful, and the meal can be a bit pricy. For easier parking, you can park at a multilevel lot at the corner of California Street and Castro Street. Otherwise, I'd recommend checking out View Street in the direction away from the Caltrain station."
740,"My favorite sushi joint when I'm craving sashimi or nigiri! I usually get the regular nigiri or the chirashi bowl. The nigiri is good, but if you don't like wasabi make sure to tell them! They put a bit of wasabi inside each piece between the fish and rice. The chirashi bowl is very good and the sushi rice is so addictive. I am normally unable to finish the entire bowl through.I don't usually get the rolls here (if I want rolls in go to TGI I'm Campbell) but the Tomi special roll with salmon and seared scallop is delish. I've also tried the spicy salmon roll. Also good but it has lots of onions."
741,"I've been to Sushi Tomi for dinner years ago and remember liking it, so we went back on a weekday for lunch.Place opens at 11:30am, best to get there early and wait.  It's really popular!FREE hot tea - it's super temperature hot, be careful.We got:lunch combo $10.90 ea- comes with miso soup first, then the bento box where you can 2 items, some little salad, and rice.  I got Salmon Teriyaki and Sashimi - both are pretty good.B. got lunch combo saba & sashimi $10.90 - it was really full afterwards.We also got some nigiri that's way expensive at $5-5.90 for 2 pieces.  Hotate, Tako, Unagi.Bill before tip $41.98.  Charged it."
742,"Very local ambience and like their salmon sashimi and the friend sushi bomb stuff, hehehe (spicy and definitely not sushi, so that friend of yours who does not like sushi can also go...). The service is pretty quick. It gets quite busy even on weekdays and they don't take reservations. We had a 20 mins wait before we got served."
743,"Mediocre food, definitely overpriced for what it is. Not sure where people set their bars at, I don't understand why the rating is that good, it's almost shocking."
744,"Solid Japanese food. Sashimi is nice and fresh. Green tea is hot and flavorful. Service is fast. Nothing much to complain about here. Try to get here at opening to get seated. Otherwise it's about a 30-45 min wait depending on your group size. The Extra Special Chirashi was pretty good with fresh sashimi, soft rice that's perfectly seasoned."
745,I went in for lunch with two friends and there were people waiting outside.  No one manning the hostess podium.  Another customer just barged in to put their name on the list ahead of me.  I walked away discussed.
746,This place's sushi was extremely delicious. The taste is so great and the sushi just melts in your mouth. Its something that I would want to eat again. I was very pleased.
747,"Top quality sushi and sashimi, plus authentic classics like hamachi kama and many others! Simply delicious and superior quality and freshness."
748,"Not bad, but overhyped. I'd give it 3.5, but rounded down for the awful abalone and laughable toro. 5/5 for Tomi's roll: oh man this was the star. Charred salmon outside, yellow tail inside, super flavorful and delicious. 1/5 for the abalone: Holy crap this was bad. Tasted like I was eating a plastic children's toy (texture and taste-wise) Everyone at the table had no desire to finish their pieces. 1/5 for the toro: TORO IS FATTY TUNA. This was the least marbly piece of toro I've ever received, looked like slightly lighter regular tuna at a premium price. 5/5 for the salmon: it was really fresh salmon sashimi, quite tasty. I'd go again for the tomi's roll and salmon... just please keep that abalone away from me."
749,"In a sea of sushi restaurants in the area, sushi tomi stands out.  I think it's a little more expensive than others but the sushi is a notch above rest.  Seems to be always crowded at mealtimes though, so come a little early or late."
750,"Fish seemed kind of not fresh? I only ordered a roll though, so maybe that was an off case. Location is nice and tucked away; price point is not unreasonable."
751,"Really good sushi for great value. We each got the 10pc omakase (comes with miso soup) and a few extra pieces for about $50. Not bad at all! Fish is really really fresh. Good variety too. Fresh octopus is divine. I thought the uni tasted a little off, but maybe it was just an off day. Everything else was delicious. Wait is not too bad since they have quick turnaround. Must visit for sushi lovers."
752,"I hate sushi, so this review is based on the non-sushi stuff they carry.This is a very authentic Japanese restaurant with a lil fusion feel to it. The menu lists a wide variety of items"
753,Solid solid sushi joint with rhe best customer service I have seen in the sushi industry!! Ordered a ton of rolls and everything was superb!!!!Tip: no reservations and theres always a wait :/Enjoy!
754,"When I first looked at the menu and saw that everything was close to $20, I thought this was going to be yet another overpriced sushi joint that charges too much for small, pretentiously presented portions. But I was definitely wrong!I went for the combination special, which gives 2 entrees for $18.90. I chose salmon and tuna sashimi, and saba shioyaki (grilled mackerel) as my entrees. It came with rice, miso soup, and salad. Was it pricey? Yes, but so worth it! They gave 7-8 pieces of sashimi - super fresh, fatty buttery cuts, and each piece was waaay bigger than your average piece of sashimi. The mackerel dish came with two large pieces of mackerel, grilled perfectly. Delicious, healthy, AND worth the money.Now I see why there's always a wait here. I'll definitely be back!"
755,"I picked this place because of the high star rating and was very disappointed. The quality of the sushi is very poor. We had the Tomi special roll, California roll, and spicy tuna roll. They were just ok. Definitely had better sushi before."
756,"Best sushi around, but honestly San Francisco has better sushi-go places. Unfortunately city is far."
757,"Tomi bento: chicken, ca roll. Skip the fish.Spider roll ok.Salmon skin handrollSalmon collar is a salad."
758,Always great sushi.  Pretty convenient for Friday take out.  Their shrimp tempura is excellent as well as the rainbow and spider rolls.
759,"Great and authentic Japanese food. We had sashimi which was so fresh, fish collar grilled, uni rolls. No doubt it is the best Japanese restaurant in the area"
760,"Been here 5 times over the last 2 years. Consistently great sushi made with a superb quality fish. Absolutely adore sashimi. (Special rolls are great, too!)On a downside, it's always packed and the shortest queue I've ever had was 30 minutes. But it's defenitely worth the wait."
761,"Guess we got lucky in the minimal wait:  one night, at prime dinner time in the middle of the week, had no problem walking-in, got seated immediately.My Tokyo-born friend says Sushi Tomi has been a dependable go-to for years.The restaurant was full except for a table or two.Other diners were chatting in Japanese so that unscientifically backs it up as being authentic.Steak teriyaki was good.  Omakase includes high quality sashimi, although slices are modest.  If you have a typical American-sized appetite, you probably wouldn't get full.Real, grated wasabi always wins points with me.  None of the paste stuff from the tube or otherwise.  Kudos, Sushi Tomi, on that.Not a great value for dinner so, minus a star for that.  Nor was it a mind-blowing meal.Still, Sushi Tomi is a solid option for sushi in downtown Mountain View."
762,Best sushi place in Bay Area so far.  I feel like I'm in Japan when I go here.  They serve the best cuts (potions as well) of sashimi.  Great location as well - walking distance to where I salsa dance - Alberto's.
763,"Sushi Tomi remains the steadfast consistent favorite and Japanese staple of the high tech slaves, particularly the Microsofties and the Googlers and of course the StartUppers operating in uh...stealth mode (sounds very 007). It's the de facto fail safe sushi spot and for those who cannot get enough of bento, some big ass stupid name rolls, teriyaki, tempura, udon, soba, and run of the mill nigiri, it hits the spot without too much wallet shafting, where there's a little something for everyone.For those who are really uber serious about their sushi, and I don't mean the ""sushi snob"" roller types (into big ass stupid name rolls and spicy toona handrolls), and prefer simplicity in the form of a pristine piece of properly sliced fish molded over a pad of sushi rice, you can find satisfaction at the sushi bar. Sushi Tomi is not a high end sushi restaurant by any means, and has more of a good neighborhood vibe. The fish selection is generally very impressive, and it has grown leaps and bounds in the last 3+ years following the remodel (unlike ""remodel"" in the Chinese restaurant world where it means ""we're flat ass broke or bankrupt, and can't pay the rent, maybe owe gambling debts and back taxes and must close, and thus we can only afford newspaper to plaster our windows to hide away the shame"").The best nigiri experience was with the former head sushi chef, who at some point had to handle kitchen duties due to being short staffed. I have a feeling he is no longer behind the bar, or even if so, on very rare occasions. A chef there who has survived the sous chef lineup changes and started off as one, has worked his way up and is now the head chef (the guy in the center). The new head chef is a nice guy, but his nigiri is absolutely not my style. For those who prefer bigger rice pads and larger thicker (re slightly untextured at times) cuts of fish, might see this as a good thing.Sometime within the last 3 to 5 years, this restaurant has decided to capitalize on ""omakase"". It can be now ordered from the white board, so no more magical mysticism, around $35 for maybe 10 random pieces of sushi, or for $60, you get something similar (maybe a few extra pieces, an extra cut roll) with three appetizer/sides. Why not just call this the tasting menu?Now if you prefer not to fall for this schitck, you can take the ordering reins yourself, via observing what is in the Hoshizaki refrigeration counters, reading the daily specials on the white board (including ""fresh fish flown in from Tsukiji Fish Market), and having a basic knowledge of what your preferences vs what they offer and what you think they do well in.With that said, the $19 for 6 pc nigiri sampler from the white board Tsukiji fish special (or $24 for sashimi sampler), is quite a decent bargain. This boils down to a little over $3 for a single piece, which you are getting rarely seen Japanese fish (mostly white fleshed fish, a major turnoff for salmon/toro/hamachi lovers who are into the oily fatty one dimensional textures). But if you are of the adventurous type, and can appreciate a range of supple to firm textures of imported Japanese white fleshed fish (shiromi), look no further than Sushi Tomi in the South Bay (especially with Kitsho's chef retiring and Jin Sho costing more).I can't even tell you what I had, the chef said ""it's my choice"" even though I wanted to pick from the selection.katsuo - hardly seared on the outside or not much treatment at all. Very nice texture and decent taste. Would have benefited from a wee bit of ponzu and thin garlic slice (or garlic paste)The other 5 are somewhat similar in taste, with slightly different textures, a few were obvious belly cuts. I'd hazard a guess and say three of them were:amadai (tilefish / red horsehead if aka-amadai)kue - kelp (mud) grouper (no muddy taste at all, pristine and delicious, sadly no kelp flavor)madaiOther items:Zaru soba - for a version that's not sourced to fresh noodles, it was cooked well and easily surpasses what the competition makes. Modest portion, allowing you to sample other items. Was given hon-wasabi (from tube I think, not freshly ground), a nice touch over the kryponite green paste stuff.kinmedai (alfosino) - chef took two slices and proceeded to sear it with a blowtorch...my heart sunk. Luckily it hardly cooked the fish, and in fact gave it a nice boost. A little shiso underneath, with sea salt on top, and this specimen was quite delicious. Probably not from Japan, it was $7 for a pair.Saba - Ordered this as things were not going too well with the nigiri molding. Unforuntately the mackeral was situated in front of the sous chef, who was allowed to make the order. While he may be good at making rolls, his nigiri molding skill was severely lacking, as the fish acted more like a pivot on the rice, rather than adhering to it. The way the fish was sliced was not done in a nigiri molding friendly way either. Luckily I did not order aji...Kanpyo maki - good"
764,"One of the best sushi places in the Bay Area, with great and very friendly service.Really delicious and fresh rolls.The only downside is due to high demand you need to put your name on the list and wait outside , could takes more than half an hour since some times it's packed... waiting outside is not pleasant."
765,I am a sushi lover. I find myself eating sushi quite often I like to eat sushi in many different restaurant and try new places. Basically I don't have a favorite place or anything like that a couple of days ago I tried Shushi Tommy I had some sashimi and a california roll. The sushi was good and well made. I enjoyed my meal very much.
766,"Bad service!!! I came here with my coworkers today for lunch and I have to admit that the food was decent but we encountered the lamest thing ever. We had a VISA gift card ($40) and our total bill (after taxes) came out to be $41 so I gave the GC and my credit card to the waiter and asked him to charge us the full $40 on GC and charge $7 on my CC.He refused to charge the full $40 on the GC and came up with the stupidest reason I've ever heard.First he said that he's UNABLE to charge the full amount on the GC if the bill is over $40 because the VISA company worries that we will not tip the waiter since there aren't enough funds on the GC. Then he said that it's required by law that tips are 20% of your total bill and so he can only charge 80% of the $40 on the GC. Are you serious? First of all I already gave him my CC and told him to put $7 on the card so that would be $40 + $7 = $47. You're telling me that is not enough to cover the bill and the tips? Excuse me, when the hell did we come up with a law that requires us to pay 20% of tip? And when did credit companies worry about people not tipping at restaurants?I've always used gift cards from major CC companies like AMEX and VISA at restaurants with no problems at all - Even when the bill exceed the amount of the GC. They would just extract however much was on the GC (for example, $25) and put the rest on my CC or I'd pay with cash. Lame. I will not return to this place again."
767,This place should be at an average of 4.5 or 5 stars but it is tough with so many reviews. Just get the Omakase. It's 10 pieces for not that much but it is worth it. Hands down the best sushi in the Bay.
768,"Look elsewhere if you want fancy, creative rolls. The offerings here are straight-forward, simple and fresh. I enjoyed my nigiri so much that I wolfed down the entire platter in five minutes flat. It might have had something to do with the loonnng wait before we were seated (make reservations, people!), but either way, it was bomb diggity. I tried a little bit of the White Tuna Don and it was yummy. Everyone kept on raving about how good the rice was. The tempura was pretty standard, but I need to take a second to turn on the bitch and complain about the Teriyaki Chicken. What. The. Hell. It tasted like someone took a chicken and wringed out all of its juices. So dry and dense! Just awful! Skip this and stick to the fish."
769,"Sushi Tomi is a fantastic deal for the price (at least at lunch time -- I've never been for dinner). I've never been to any restaurant in the U.S. that gives you so much sashimi for such a low price. The chirashi bowls are gorgeous and teeming with fish -- I had a lot of fun letting the salmon roe melt in my mouth.That being said, Sushi Tomi is not for the connoisseur. Sushi Tomi lacks the traditional attention to detail in cuts and presentation, but at this price, I really don't care."
770,"Best sushi on the Peninsula. Good portions, nice specials, very fresh fish. The Special Tomi Roll is definitely my go to, but omakase is the best if you like to be surprised. They don't take reservations, which is annoying, and there is pretty much no ambience, but sometimes you can't have it all ; )"
771,"I was pleasantly surprised by Sushi Tomi after having several bad experiences with ""hot on Yelp"" places that I've tried (as Sushi Tomi is currently on the list!)I didn't have trouble finding it but I never knew it was so far from the main Castro St area. I kept looking around and finally realized that it was two blocks away from Castro and not just one where I tried to park. Parking can be tough and hard to find but I imagine since this place is so far out that it would not be as bad during rush hours for lunch and dinner.This place is not tiny but has the cozy feel of a small sushi bar. They do have tables as well and can probably seat a decent sized group. Their menu is simple but delicious, their ""Dons"" especially the white tuna with special sauce is just awesome. The sashimi is very fresh, the chirashi is reasonably priced and their negitoro (most places only have negihama!) and the futomaki was SO good. They make their own egg and stamp it sometimes if you order a chirashi which is kind of cool. I am usually turned off by sushi places where I end up spending about $60 for two when it's not premium sushi, but this place was EXTREMELY worth it and I am now craving to go back for their omakase which starts from $30.00 and up; what a deal!"
772,"This place was packed on a Monday night around 8pm.  Waited about 20 minutes for the 3 of us but definitely worth it.I love the casual, energetic atmosphere;  you also get the feeling that this is definitely a small business run by a family so that's always good.  Once we sat down we got a free bowl of edamame (yum!), warm miso soup, and started on some refreshing alcoholic drinks. My fiancé and i ordered a bunch of small dishes to share;  spider roll, eel roll, red snapper roll, and beef teriyaki.  All were fresh and delicious.   Would prob stick with the sushi though;  the beef was slightly overcooked.Our friend highly recommended the chirashi over rice ($30) which is a bowl of a mix of fresh raw fish/.Love this place!"
773,"I came here for lunch with my mom and sister because we were craving uni. My sis called ahead to make sure they had uni today, and the lady on the phone said yes. So when we arrived, which was around noon, the place was already full. We had to wait about 15 min to be seated. We ordered chicken don, sashimi lunch, abalone, and 6 pieces of uni. However, our waitress, Mishiyo (I think that's her name!) told us they didn't have uni today. We were bummed so we had to order something else. We decided to get hamachi and shiro-maguro. Mishiyo felt bad and kept apologizing to us. She gave us edamame, miso soup, salad, and ice cream. Later on, Mishiyo told us that they had uni so we were beyond excited! Overall, everything tasted great and the service was excellent all thanks to Mishiyo. I'm not a fan of the abalone but my mom loved it!"
774,"One of my favorite sushi places! Get there early and get on the waiting list! But it is worth the wait. Some of the best sashimi, nigiri and rolls I've had! The parking lot across the street is usually fine to park in to avoid the Castro St traffic"
775,I got food poisoning after eating their Spicy Tuna and California roll. Be careful. Their stuff may not be new.
776,"Sushi Tomi is probably the best sushi joint in the south bay. i'm a fan of sushi sam's as well, but that's not really in south bay.they have fresh fish, a wide selection on their menu, and everything is pretty well prepared. why only 3 stars then? well, 2 issues - the long lines, and kappo nami nami. Kappo nami nami, while not a sushi-ya, does have sushi options and their fish is a bit fresher than sushi tomi. prices are correspondingly higher, but it's worth it in my opinion.another note - tomi sushi their sister store does not seem to be quite as good in my experiences there. not sure if they share chefs or not, but tomi has had much better consistency in my numerous dines there."
777,"Sushi Tomi is my favorite sushi lunch spot in the south bay at the moment, though admittedly part of the reason is its convenient location.For an indication of the food quality, just check out the line of mostly Japanese patrons snaking out the door at noon. Needless to say, getting here early (or very late) is a prerequisite. (Note: They do take reservations, for both lunch and dinner)The indoor setting of the restaurant is minimalist Japanese: white with wood trim, not overburdened with decorations. It has a nice feel to it, perhaps due to its small size; It's bright and cozy at the same time.Like most of the better Japanese places, Sushi Tomi is no bargain restaurant. Lunch here, including tip, will run between $10 and $20 per person, more if you're really hungry, or if decide on the omakase menu, where you let the sushi chef pick the food for you.Here's some of what I've tried here off the menu:--- Lunch combo with Chicken Teriyaki and CA roll. Reasonably priced at $9.90. Everything was delicious and of the highest quality.  A larger bento lunch can also be had for $12.50.--- Unagi Don, a mouth-watering BBQ eel in succulent sauce over rice. Simply orgasmic (especially if you're an eel fan like me). A reasonable $14 for such ambrosia.--- Basic sushi combo platter: total price $14; Twelve pieces, half of them nigiri (yellowtail, salmon, tuna, scallop, shrimp, mackerel), the other half comprising a small, basic tuna roll). The fish was delicious, very fresh and the presentation was nice; The nigiri pieces were of average size. My combo also included miso soup and small bowl of edamame. A pot of fresh green tea was placed on the table and our cups regularly topped off. A really good deal, but next time Ill pony up a few dollars more for the ""special"" sushi combo ($19), which my friend ordered. (And resulted in some food jealousy on my part)Want to impress friends or visitors with great Japanese food? Take them here for lunch, Just be sure to make reservations or show up early."
778,"I am SO disappointed with Sushi Tomi. This used to be our favorite place for sushi when we lived in Mountain View and so we made it a point to go and eat some while we were in the area. We even waited to sit at the sushi bar. They had a nice selection of fish and so I was excited to be eating some good sushi.We started off with blue shrimp, tai, hamachi, kampachi, mirugai and hirame. Then we embarked upon uni, togokai, ankimo and abalone sashimi. When the first lots of sushi arrived I was shocked at how big the piece of rice was. I mean it was huge!! On top of that, the rice didn't have any vinegary taste. The rice was on the warm side and this made the fish at room temperature by the time I had it in my mouth. I was glad we got the abalone as sashimi because it was perfectly crunchy with great flavor. In fact, the quality of the fish was all pretty good, they just didn't put the tender loving care they used to in making the sushi. Maybe it was the fact that the owner Tak-san wasn't helping us. We got another chef. I don't know. I just noticed that the other people's cut rolls were falling apart and the edges were raggedy like it was cut with a not-so-sharp knife. The young man's agedashi tofu was also not that good. It was hard and not soft on the inside. The zaru soba was cooked well -- al dente -- but the sauce was a little on the sweet side for me.All in all, I was very saddened by our meal here. It's not worth the wait anymore. I think their popularity has grown so much that they're in such a rush to churn out the sushi that in the process, they've compromised on the what sushi is all about. Sushi is supposed to be pieces of art and trust me...what we had tonight was definitely not what I would consider artistic in any shape or manner."
779,"Very good Japanese food no matter if you get sushi, sashimi, or just the general meals. It is slightly on the pricey side, but worth the money. Very very busy on weekends and Friday nights, so if you arrive right slap in the middle of dinner hours, you'll be forced to wait for a table -- sometimes, for a long time. If you don't mind, you'll be rewarded with good service and excellent food. Otherwise, make sure you reserve a table before you go. Make sure you try some of the specials of the day, especially the sashimi/sushi -- definitely won't be disappointed. Every sushi/sashimi item we've ever ordered has been absolutely divine and if I had more room in my stomach, I would've eaten more every time. If you are lucky enough to get a seat at the sushi bar, then you're REALLY in for a treat. Master sushi chef ""Tak-san"", who is also the owner, will make recommendations depending on what his fresh catch of the day happens to be or just go Omakase -- chef's choice. His presentations are indeed intricate and often you don't really feel like messing it up. Omakase is and can be expensive if you're not careful, but hey, it's THE best way to go. I think the most expensive we've had was $300 for 2 persons, but that included crab soup and kobe beef tataki which is out of this world. One of my favorite Japanese restaurants in the South Bay."
780,"Sushi was okay. The rice was not very good - kind of dry and no flavor. Great apps - esp the fish head/collar and fried mackerels. The oyster was just okay. We got the omakase sushi - the Mackerel was the best (and I don't usually like mackerel).  Uni was probably the worst thing we ate that meal. Service was not great - i know the place was busy, but they kept taking our plates away before we were even finished.The bathrooms were a little on the dirty side, which doesn't speak well about the cleanliness of the place."
781,"Today is the last day of 20% off. For the last week, they've had this great discount to celebrate 20 years on business. This place looks small on the outside but it has two rooms and must seat 50 people.Had the combo: for your bento box you can choose two: tempura, saba shio, salmon shio, beef teri, chicken teri, or pork cutlet. You get a small salad and a bowl of fluffy white rice. After 15 minutes, my bento had two small pieces of saba shio, six pieces of tempura. The saba shio and tempura were perfectly cooked and tasted good. The salad was par for the course and the white rice was fresh and fluffy. $10.95 regular price and today, the last day to get an additional 20% off. yeah! Thanks Sushi Tomi !!!My friends loved their sashimi. I tried a piece of the tuna roll and thought it was sweet.Customer service: very good and attentive.Decor: clean.Parking: very limited. Tip: drive around the corner and park on a residential street.On second thought, considering the area; this place is 4 stars on quality and value."
782,Authentic and tasty sushi place in south bay. The line is a bit long most of the time. But it's worth it.
783,"I have come to the conclusion that Sushi Tomi in Mountain View downtown is not as good as the sister restaurant Tomi Sushi in San Jose.My last visit to this restaurant was a disappointing experience. Service was terrible. I understand it was a really busy Friday night but leaving your customers unattended for a long time is not excusable. Our server simply disappeared after serving us tea. We tried to flag down other servers but none would even make eye contact with us. After half an hour someone else finally came and took our order. While the quality of the fish is comparable, the nigiri and rolls were not as nicely crafted as their sister restaurant. Some might like it more because the portion is indeed more generous. I still prefer having my sushi the delicate and elegant way - maki chopped into equal size pieces, nigiri no bigger than bite size. The sushi here are shy in comparing. Extra Special Chriashi has decent but not spectacular fish selection. Some of the sashimi cut were unfortunately too thick. The uni was not good at all. No complimentary green tea ice cream after dinner? Wanted to ask for it but our server was again no where to be found. Not happy with my dinner. Would just stick with Tomi Sushi from now on."
784,I have heard about Sushi Tomi on numerous occasions and it had been in the back of my mind for a very long while. It was not until a couple months ago that I finally gave it a try. There were all these fancy sushi joints in the area and I was simply too distracted to wander into this modest little restaurant at the outskirt of downtown mountain view. I had sushi and rolls at the other Sushi Tomi location and decided to do Izayaka style here. I was intrigued. It is wrong to be so fond of something after such a brief encounter? Shiokara and Ikura Ochazuke were refreshing. Sake Onigiri and Korokke were surprisingly simple and good. I do wish the Sunagimo Skewer was a bit more delicate.
785,"Best sushi place in the area. Every time my parents come visit me from Japan, they always ask me to take them here. If you want a real sushi experience with reasonable pricing, I would recommend giving this place a shot. It's definitely worth a visit. ( get Extra special nigiri!!) Be aware that they do not take reservations so prepare to wait in line at least 20 min unless you are willing to go there right when it opens (5:30)."
786,"So... I lost my sushi virginity to this place. Came here around 9 p.m. with a friend and we still had a half an hour wait! Well worth the wait though--the menu is pretty standard with regards to offering the norm in what you would expect from a Japanese restaurant. We each got the dinner set--he got the teriyaki and California rolls and I had the sashimi and gyoza. The dinner combination also came with miso soup and salad. The sesame dressing on the salad was pretty superb. Food came out pretty quickly, although it might have been because we were one of the last tables who were putting in their order. I was definitely pleasantly surprised to see that I got about eight pieces of Sashimi with this meal! The sashimi tasted super fresh, although it was a bit bland for my liking, but apparently when people ""love"" sushi, they eat other types, so I'll just have to give it another try!The gyoza was good and extremely crunchy. Friend said that he enjoyed his teriyaki and California rolls. Definitely a good place to eat, albeit a bit on the expensive side. I'll probably come back and try some more sushi though! :)"
787,"My Google friend says this is the best sushi restaurant in Mountain view. We came here together at Saturday noon, waited for 15min and get a seat. There are not many appetizers at lunch. Just ordered some sushi and rice bowl. Turns out to be really good, fresh and yummy. Definitely recommend here!"
788,"Had a company birthday party at this restaurant and it was pretty nice, our waitress Samantha was very kind and very attentive to our group!The california rolls were delicious and the sake bombs were too goodIn all, this place is very nice and I'd come back"
789,"I came here in a group of around 20 people for my best friend bday on a Saturday night. We had reservations ahead but more people showed up then as planned but they were kind enough to accommodate all of us. My date and I ordered the 2 item combo in which I ordered the salmon teriyaki and sashimi. We also ordered the Tomi special roll with hamachi. I really don't see what the rave is all about here. The sashimi is tasted pretty fresh.. But everything else is just mediocre. I've had much better elsewhere. There's really nothing really superb about their rolls either... My friend didn't like any of the rolls she ordered. The only thing good about this place is they have really good service and were really accommodating to our group.. Even when we were drunk. Overall, this is not on my go to place for Sushi."
790,"A family favorite. It's always my dad's choice for lunch. Well, when he succumbs to the fact that we're not gonna eat any type of Asian noodles that day which he'd eat everyday if he could. ;-)Highlights:- Lunch combos: excellent food, great prices, good portions. Combo of 2 items for $9 and a tomi bento with bunch of stuff for $11 and sushi lunches for around that as well.- Tomi bento: comes with all sorts of stuff--everything an indecisive variety-loving girl like me needs. :-) Chicken teriyaki, tempura, saba (broiled fish), AND sashimi! You can't get any better than that. No skimping on the portions either. I'm trying to eat less--the tight pant-line is telling me to anyway--so I ate half and saved half for later. Sorry my pic is super blurry, but I wanted you to have an idea of what you will get when ordering this box.- Chicken teriyaki: good sized, thick, moist pieces with supurb teriyaki sauce--not too thin and watery but not too thick to be gooey.- Tempura: average with good batter. No broccoli though which is my fave but I'm sure it's just cause I got the super duper box and they could only fit so much in.- Saba: this is relatively new to me but I've had it at a few places and this is my favorite. Warning for the queasy that it does come with scaley looking skin on top but it's very crispy and easy to take off if you'd rather not consume the fish's exterior. What makes this the best is that we didn't find any bones! Usually you have to carefully pick through which is a hassle.- Sashimi: they gave me 3 pieces of tuna and I LOVED it! Very very very tender and melt in your mouth like. I have to try more sushi here since I just started along that road recently.- Sushi menus: I saw them posted on the wall and they entertained me. In addition to the normal sushi lunch my mom got (5 pieces nigiri, 3 rolls of 3 pieces each), they have extra special sushi, omakase ($35 for 10pieces, $60  with an appetizer) and ""$61 up if you want to trust us."" ;-)- Katzu: my dad's favorite. Oddly enough for me it's a toss up between curry house, seto, and here.- Tea: very sesame tasting Lowlights (my flip side to highlights):- It's relatively small and gets crowded so you need to come early to avoid a wait.- Miso soup: too salty for me- Big booths: not quite tatami-room like and more like a Japanese version of an enclosed picnic table, but you still have to take your shoes off.Very authentic and we never leave unsatisfied, so we'll keep coming back regularly."
791,"As a sushi addict who have been to many different sushi places around the Bay Area, it's kinda a big deal to make a place into my top favourite but sashimi of this place rocks!! Came here on a Saturday night and had to wait for a good 30 mins or so for a table. The place is pretty small and a bit off from the center street where other restaurants and stores are. Wouldn't say we experienced the best customer service tbh but it was packed, delaying service was expected. We ordered two different rolls and an extra special Chirashi bowl. The rolls were ok, pretty good but nothing impressive. However, their chirashi bowl was a BOMB. Raw fish slices were so fresh and tender, especially the uni which was totally stunning as it melt right in your mouth. The variation was a plus, too. It's been a while so I'm not quite sure about the price but the food's price wasn't expensive for its quality, definitely worth it.All in all, I love this place from the first sashimi-taste lol. Highly recommend!!"
792,"Came here because of the good reviews from yelp. The service here is so so, slow.Here is what I ordered:Appetizer: Chicken wings, Gyoza, Monkfish liver Omakase sashimi(2 red tuna, 2 toro, 2 salmon, 2 hiramasa, 2 tai, 1 amaebi, uni, scallop with miso soup.)Wild King Salmon Sashimi, Uni SushiLove the sashimi, just like most yelper said FRESH. The omakase sashimi is a really good deal $32 (13pcs)On the other hand, the wild King salmon sashimi is way too expensive! $18!!! Are you kidding me??? Also, Uni Sushi $8!! Both of them are totally NOT worth it."
793,"Amazing taste of their nigiri! Love the Anago, it's so soft and I like the sweet flavor. Also, salmon is very fresh! I'm not a big fan of sashimi, but after this dinner I decided to try their Chirashi bowl next time."
794,"Great sushi at the price point. Staff is very nice and the fish is fresh. The tempura is not the best, but the sashimi and sushi are great. The dinner specials are very good and offer a great experience."
795,"Maybe my expectations were too high, but everything was just okay. Given the hype, I was expecting to blown away. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night at around 7pm and waited maybe 20 minutes or so as I had expected. I knew Sushi Tomi was a popular place, so I used the time to read Yelp and think about what to order. It seems the trick for dinner is to come right at 7. Not 10 minutes after we arrived, the crowd had grown tenfold!That said, the way they distribute seating seems inefficient. We were two people, and yet they gave us a a 6-person table to ourselves...we offered to share our table with another couple but the waitstaff said it was fine (I'm not sure if the people waiting outside would have agreed, though!). Nonetheless, it was a nice meal. Knowing it to be pricey, we ordered a bit of several things rather than splurge on one luxury item. We ordered a regular chirashi (going against the review of Randy F., whom I trust a lot), a caterpillar roll, and a katsu don. We should've listened to Randy F.! Although the chirashi had good variety (the tuna was nice and I liked the egg), it definitely was not as fresh or amazing as I had read about from other reviews. We probably should've gotten the extra special chirashi, but my cheapness won out. I'll take note for next time! Meanwhile, the caterpillar roll was a good, solid roll, but not particularly memorable. And the katsu don was also good, but not great (probably not worth the price). That said, the service was good as the waiter came by and checked up on us multiple times. Parking, on the other hand, was pretty bad. We were lucky to find an open spot in one of the lots, but you may have to park far away in order to find a spot available.In the end, the experience was pleasant, if not particularly memorable. Nothing blew me away, and at these prices and with my expectations that was a recipe for failure. Maybe I should order differently next time. Can I get a do-over?"
796,One of the best sushi spots in the Bay Area. This is one of those restaurants that you might drive past 100 times thinking it would just be alright but the food is truly good and the service is 100% solid.
797,"I came here on my visit last year and remembered being wowed by their Sake Don (hearty slices with utmost freshness).I visited again on this trip because it once again played the reliable neighborhood sushi joint role.I got my reliable Sake Don and although I must admit I wasn't as impressed this second round, I definitely thought it was worth the price (Sake Don consists of sashimi pieces on top of rice served in a bowl). My friend told me about a roll that they make that's not on the menu, creatively named the ""Seared Scallop and Salmon roll"". It was heaven. The scallops were seared just enough that they gained a slightly brown char while managing to keep their overall raw texture. Their salmon was good and went even better with the avocado and spicy mayo sauce. The roll was topped with the mustardy green that looks like a thin clover, often served atop steaks (please message me if you know what I'm talking about because I can't remember/find the name of this green for the life of me.)The miso soup was way too salty and the Agedashi Tofu was uneventful. Overall, I really like this place because service is fast and the prices more than reasonable.If I had to, I'd return again but for the time being I'm ready to try something new."
798,"I've been coming to Sushi Tomi for a few years and it's one of my favorites for lunch and dinner in the South Bay. The fish is flown in from Tsukiji. They post their options on the board by the hostess stand. If they run out, they run out. Lately, I've been ordering some variation of their chirashi. The fish has to be fresh for that dish. If my Spidey senses are tingling regarding the freshness of the seafood, chicken teriyaki it is! And no, I've never had any issues with the quality of their fish. Portions are very reasonable. They have a wide variety of options on their menu, from sushi to cooked fish to teriyaki to noodles to grilled and fried items. There are plenty of options for everyone. The sushi is simple and basic. This is not the place for ""designer"" or special rolls, thumping music or boozing it up with your sushi chef (head to Palo Alto or San Jose). This is THE place to go to for simple, high quality, authentic Japanese cuisine. I know the wait can be long so I try to arrive before or after their peak times. Service is friendly and efficient. The noise level can get really high when it's a packed house. I've always been able to find parking nearby and there is a parking lot across the street. There is a reason why the lines are always long and have been since I've been coming here . Check it out!"
799,"If you're in Downtown Mountain View before noon on a weekday, I recommend Sushi Tomi! Amazing lunch!! And such a steal, too! For ~$10 you get a hefty and delicious meal!My bff and I were lucky and were one of the last ones to snag a table before the restaurant was inundated with a crowd and line of people. Initially, I wanted the daily lunch special, but it was curry and fried food with it so I opted for the lunch bento special of sashimi and broiled saba... Sooo yummy and filling. Food came out pretty quickly, too. The salmon sashimi was my favorite. It was fresh and practically melted in your mouth like butter.Also, we were really lucky because we got 20% off our bill since we ate here during their anniversary. Neat!I also must add that Tomi Sushi in San Jose is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants. The food is pretty much identical (ditto with the name), so I'm assuming they're managed by the same owner?"
800,"-Spicy Tuna roll (6 pc for $6.50): spicy and full of tuna-BBQ Unagi roll (6 pc for $6.50): great tasting with avocado and unagi that has a drizzle of sweet BBQ sauceWaiting always seems to be an issue since they don't accept reservations. Get there early, put your name on the sign-up list and wait for your name to be called."
801,"This is the third time I've eaten here. The first time and second, as well as the third time, I've been really impressed with the sushi. I usually get their spicy tuna and unagi rolls and I'm always so happy with them. It's fresh and tasty and the rice or seaweed isn't mushy. Even the tempura is good, the batter light and they serve it to you right outta the deep fryer!Service is usually attentive, but tonight it was poor (I'm still giving 5 stars, based on an average of eating their 3 times). I waited 20 minutes for my rolls and by then, my bf had finished his tempura dinner already. You had to ask for your water to be filled and I had to make sure that they didn't forget my sushi order. I don't know what it was tonight, but the usual service wasn't there.When you go, there's usually already a wait so you have to put your name on a list and wait around. It's a pretty popular and average sized place.P.S: They don't accept AmEx"
802,"Ok, so it may be worth waiting a half hour for a table here.  But only when I'm not too hungry, because otherwise that just won't do.  Make reservations if you wanted to be seated in a timely manner.Like Min L., I'm a fan of the combo dinner.  Such a great deal for $16.90.  I like the spicy tuna roll, but their sukiyaki is too sweet.  (pictures posted)P.S.  I saw 1 of their waiters wearing an IEEE shirt.  HOT.  The shirt not the waiter."
803,"Woohoo! My Birthday lunch treat from my brother!Came here at around noon and the place was almost full. After 1pm there was a line out the door. Got the nigiri sushi and the ""extra special chirashi"".  Waitress told me that the difference between special and extra special being tuna and salmon toro versus regular, crab versus uni and rather than regular shrimp (ebi) , I get sweet shrimp (amaebi).  All of the fish is fresh and rice seasoned with great flavors!My bro had a beer that came with some edamame.Good service and attentive. This place is always packed. Either make a reservation or be prepared to wait."
804,"By far the best place with the freshest sashimi if you are willing to shell out a little extra.Am a big fan of chirashi and had the Extra Special Chirashi at Sushi Tomi and it was mouth-watering fresh and delicious!  Chirashi came with toro(otoro), maguro(I think they are actually chutoro), sake, hamachi, amaebi (include the deep fried lightely salted shrimp head), anago, uni, aji, ikura and tamago. Oh, and did I forget to mention the wakame and Denb(Sweet Shrimp Powder). The chirashi was simply sensational and worth every penny.Will definitely return!"
805,I was visiting Mountain View. We were hungry so I looked up on Yelp. Very fresh and good sushi restaurant. The staff is so friendly. I would definitely come back.
806,"Thanks to yelp, I found Sushi Tomi a while back and whenever I'm in Mountain View, I eat here for Japanese food. They also have a sister restaurant, Tomi Sushi, in San Jose.The restaurant itself is not very large, and it tends to get busy on the weekends. If you're coming with a group, it's usually best to call ahead and make reservations. The service is usually pretty good.I agree with many of the yelpers in that Sushi Tomi's sashimi is fresh and tasty. Although I've ordered several items here, the one that stands out in my mind is the white tuna tataki (tuna served with sliced onions, white radish, and garlic ponzu sauce). Be sure to order this as an appetizer or side dish!"
807,It would have been four stars but the service here sucks! We walk through the door for our 6 pm reservation. No need for reservation the restaurant was at 1/4 capacity! We waited like five minutes before we were seated! WT!Then we had to wait for a while for someone to come take our order. We ordered the sushi dinner and the Chirashi. The food came out really fast! My sushi was on a plate shaped like a fish! CUTE! It didn't look liked a lot of food but I couldn't finish. All the fish was really fresh!
808,"Really fresh fish. Very pleasant staff.Not a wait during the lunch rush. No special rolls selection, just the basics.  But what they have is YUMMY!"
809,"Not the most glamorous spot but the food here does not disappoint! The wait though was LONG! We had to wait about an hour for a table for 2 for Thursday night dinner. Parking can also be challenging near the restaurant. Back to the food-I highly recommend TORO anything(tuna, salmon etc). While a lot of places offer toro options nowadays, I find Sushi Tomi's toros the freshest.  We also enjoyed the Uni, Ebi, Unagi, Tamago sushis. For a hearty entrée, we really enjoyed the Katsu Don. The Katsu was juicy and tender. The sukiyaki sauce was also just at the perfect balance of sweet and savory. I'd go out of my way to come to this place!"
810,"When I'm back at home and am about to leave for school again, my parents always treats our whole family out at this place.I used to be indifferent about sushi, but after so many years of trying the 'worst' and the 'best', my taste buds can finally distinguish which is which.This place falls under one of the 'best'. I love their sushi. I always get the bento box so I can pair up what I like (usually: california rolls, sashimi, salmon teriyaki) and get miso soup, salad, and rice in addition to my order.The fish used for their sashimi is definitely fresh and safe to eat. Expect this location to be crowded during lunch and dinner time, and that you will need to wait around~30 minutes. It's just that popular. There's little to no waiting space, so take a walk around Castro St. during that time (it will be enjoyable and kill time)."
811,Service is very bad!!!!!  The waitress pushed us to order when we had no idea to eat. When we finish eating the waitress tried to force us to pay!!! Is that worth to go again??
812,"Probably the best sushi I have ever had! Need to open your wallet up a bit, but it is so worth it!"
813,"A little over three years later, and with a greater appreciation for fine(r) dining, I'd still give Sushi Tomi three stars, but edging close to 3.5 stars. Dropping by for dinner with Katherine L, we ordered ourselves the amaebi, namatako tempura, hamachi kama, iwashi shioyaki, and tempura soba.Some of you know my slight dislike for sashimi, due to the texture of most fishes - given that, amaebi (raw sweet shrimp served with fried shrimp heads) was definitely a first for me, but a surprisingly delicious one. The namatako and tempura served with the soba were also pretty good, although I found Sushi Tomi's tempura items slightly oversalted in general. The hamachi kama and iwashi (whole sardine) both had good flavor and were cooked well, although parts of the hamachi were slightly overcooked and a bit tough.We managed to beat the dinner rush by showing up before 6:30pm, with a huge line forming shortly after we sat down. Service was attentive and friendly, and prices weren't bad, coming out to $29 after tax and tip per person."
814,"I'm one of those weird Japanese cuisine lovers that doesn't eat sashimi (the texture bothers me), so that immediately took Sushi Tomi off my list of sushi joints, due to their lack of specialty rolls. So while the other guys happily scarfed down their chirashi sushi, I sat there, a bit disappointed with my unagi don. The flavor wasn't quite up to par, but more importantly, the portions were just dissatisfying: most other places I've been to give you not only more pieces of unagi, but larger/thicker pieces."
815,"I had been reluctant to try Sushi Tomi since everyone had told me it is the BEST sushi in the bay so I had some seriously high expectations coming here.  I was in the area after the Mountain View Farmer's Market and decided it would be fun to grab a quick sushi snack here and try their sushi pieces.  I ordered salmon and red snapper, which I had never tried before.  The red snapper was incredibly unique - but in a delicious way, not in a euphemism for gross way.  The sushi chef suggested that I don't dip this in soy sauce to appreciate the flavors, and he definitely was right.  It was light and refreshing.  The The salmon was out of this world, mouth-gasm inducing delicious.  It encompassed everything I had ever wanted from salmon, and I loved it so much that I had to order another.  Sushi Tomi hands down has the best fish in the bay.  I don't know if they would be a good fit if you are looking for fusion rolls since they have a more straight up, traditional sushi vibe, but if you just appreciate delicious sushi, you will love it here."
816,Bad kitchen smell spoiled the entire experience. Smelled like rotten dish or old towels.
817,"We came to this place because it's four stars.  There were 8 of us including an 80 year old.  We arrived in two separate cars.  We arrived just minutes before the other car.  The store opened.  We said we are a party of 8.  The woman immediately held us.  We told her that the other four is in the parking lot, just the 80year old is slow in walking.  She started saying that people would tell her that and they just hold the seat.A minute later, we sat down, within seconds, a woman came and asked if we're ready to order.  Geez..  we didn't even have time to go through the menu yet.  The restaurant is not crowded, there's no one waiting, what's the rush?  It turns out that she's not even our waitress.  To this point, I concluded that the restaurant does not welcome large parties.We spent $340!!  To the restaurant.  The greeter needs lots of training."
818,"I came here to meet a professional from a firm and he suggested the place.  It was a sunday afternoon and we came for lunch.  They don't let you sit until everyone is there so write your name down and if people from your party are still not there, you at least will get seated right away once they do come.      I'm a big roll fan and the rolls here aren't the fanciest but they're good!  It's not my favorite place to get sushi but it is still a great choice nonetheless! I got a dragon roll and the Spicy tuna ""poki"" roll.  The tuna was super fresh and the texture was smooth!  The dragon roll was your typical dragon roll but still very good.  By the way the tea here hit the spot. What's nice about the location is after dinner, you can walk down the strip and the lights are pretty.  You can also grab dessert at Gelato Classico Italian Ice Cream or get boba at tea era or verde.  If you want a place that has a lot of desserts you can go to honey creek."
819,"Small little hole in the wall sushi spot just a couple blocks from Castro Street in downtown Mountain View. It's not horribly expensive and the quality of the sushi and sashimi here are decent. It's worth a try if you're in the area!There's street parking right outside the entrance if you're one of the lucky 3-4 cars. Otherwise, try the lot across the street. The place is small, so there's bound to be a wait after you put your name down on the list. Service is just ok; not horrible, but could have been a bit more attentive. Maybe they need another waiter or two during the dinner hours. The special Tomi roll (hamachi) was delicious and I liked the sauce on the side. I also got the hamachi nigiri (toro) and it hit the spot. Both came out to ~$20 +tip. Both my food and my friend's food came with complimentary miso soup."
820,"I am so impressed with this place!  It's such a tiny little place and it's hidden away from the main road of DTMV.  The area is pretty convenient though b/c their is a day parking lot right across the street.If you're in the mood for sashimi or fresh fish, this is the place to be.Their fish just melts in your mouth like butter, that's how yummy it is!Their selection of rolls is very limited here, but the few that they have are really good!  I didn't have a complain about any of them.Me and my friend ordered the Tomi Special Roll.  You get to decide the fish they put in it (sake, spicy tuna, & hamachi).  We wanted to try the hamachi one and what a great choice that was!  It was running for the top spot on my list, but my favorite ended up being the Super Bomb Roll.The Super Bomb Roll's presentation is amazing itself.  It looks really pretty and spicy.  Let me tell you, it IS spicy.  It's deep fried and and juicy.  I usually feel that fried rolls cook the fish too much and it ends up being really dry.  This was just spicy goodness!The caterpillar roll is good as well, but not as spectacular as the others.  It's just a typical roll and I've tasted it before.The Stuffed Gyoza Chicken was quite interesting.  I've never had something like that before.  I felt like I was eating a chicken wing that tasted like a pot sticker.  Strange, but yummy.Their Tamago Nigiri is so adorable!  I love how they basically branded the egg with their lettering.  I just love presentation!  Of course it tasted good too!Sake Nigiri, even better!  It's so simple, but you can always tell the quality of good fish when your eat it.  It has this flavor of freshness and the way it basically dissolves in your mouth.  Anyway, enough raving about this place!  This is the spot in Mtn.View for sushi, hands down!"
821,"If you are planning on coming here, watch out for the wait. If you get here at the dinner rush, you can wait from 30-45 mins. The place is small and its Downtown Mt. View, so parking is a pain. Last I heard was ""no reservations"" first come first serve, but who knows that may have changed.Love coming here for the ""Extra Special Chirashi"", yes, that is what they call it. It is fresh and is not cut too thin. I have only had one ""not"" fresh time with the uni. =(They offer a kids dinner that is great, it looks like an adult meal.And the pieces de résistance, for me, is the unlimited soda refills! Yeah me!"
822,"This place consistently delivers high quality nigiri and sashimi, and is my go-to whenever I want sushi in the Mountain View area. This is not the place to get a bunch of fusion or creative rolls - they keep things more traditional here (which I appreciate).For dinner, I usually get the combination special with beef teriyaki and sashimi. Other times, I usually get either the sashimi dinner or the sushi dinner. The rice that comes with the the combination meals is excellent as well and goes really well with the sashimi / teriyaki.TIP: There's usually a short wait for a table on weekday dinners."
823,"Finally tried this place after reading such wonderful reviews.  There was a small line when we got there around 6:30pm and a huge line after we left.  We ordered a variety of the usual stuff from the menu (see pictures).  In short, I don't understand the hype about this place.  There is nothing special here that I can see.  The menu is rather boring, the presentations are a no effort, and the taste is all meh....even my kids complained the chicken from the kid's meal was too dry and the salmon was over cooked.  The service however, was very pleasant.  The waitress was very nice, and efficient.  She even offered to bring my other son an ice cream, even though we only ordered one kid's meal for my other son.  Will I return to this place?  No.  There are so many other good Japanese places in the South Bay.  Seriously not worth the long wait!"
824,"Food quality is slightly above the Japanese food in this area, but what really made me want to write a review is the service! Pauline is our waitress today, we came in as a party of nine, I was in charge of ordering food. She helped me chose the right portion and good balance between raw fish and vegetarian/cooked fish since some of us had special diet requirement. They brought up the dishes timely and answered all our requests. This is what I call good service!"
825,My family and I love sushi so the first thing bf we did when we moved to Los Altos was try every sushi place we could find. We decided this one was the best! We always order their tomi special and hamachi sushimi.
826,"It's been a while since I've been back here, and I think I have a better appreciation for sushi now.We went for lunch, and the lunch sashimi special is a really good value for $15.90. I had a bowl of rice, miso soup, salad, and 12 pieces of sashimi.  The sashimi was generously cut and was probably 2-3x the size of the pieces at the fancier omakase places, and I had salmon, white tuna, maguro, and hamachi. Everything was fresh.  We also got a nigiri 10 piece, which included things like uni, ama ebi, hotate.  The sushi rice had flavor but wasn't amazing.For stuff brought in from Tsukiji, their prices are pretty reasonable. It's very low key and simple sushi.  The servers and hostesses there are so gracious despite it always being crazy busy.  There's always a line."
827,"This place is tucked away and pretty hidden, about 2 blocks from Castro.  When you walk in, you immediately hear people speaking Japanese, which is actually a pretty rare finding at Japanese places in the bay area.  They do take reservations, and even on a weeknight, the place was packed.We chose from a limited selection of beer, sake, and wine to start.  Everyone gets the standard miso soup, and there was also a small bowl of edemame to share.Most people go for the omakase, which comes in different prices ranges.  I don't know that I'd necessarily call it ""omakase"" when a bunch of sushi or sashimi comes to you all on one plate, but it's a pretty good deal if you want things like toro and uni.I got the yosenabe, which was a big portion, with some seafood in it.  It wasn't spectacular, but it was nice and warm on a rainy day.The place feels really authentic, and they have you take off your shoes to sit at the tables in the inner room.  There's also a small sushi bar right when you walk in.  They don't do the fancy rolls, but they have some pretty fresh fish.  They have specials on the weekends, too.Anyway, it's a cute little place for reasonably priced sushi/sashimi, especially if you like toro ;)"
828,"A nice little hole-in-the-wall find just next to the nice older section of downtown Mountain View suburbs.Had the lunch special: $8.90 for - Salmon soup: Delicious! But the fish was a bit boney...maybe it was the leftover sections from the salmon sashimi. - Sushi Rice bowl with three triangular pieces of tuna sashimi which had been very-very lightly seared + spicy chopped tuna + Ginger slices, wasabi + a toasted seaweed rice seasoning. Very good and a bit spicy because of the chopped tuna! Really different for me who normally gets something katsu-style. - Something interesting. Scallion planks: Two skewered ""planks"" [deck of card dimensions] of  3"" sections of green scallions, panko breaded and deep-fried. Reminded me of a different style of onion rings.Problem with the scallions was that they came out very late and only with some flagging down by our table.  While tasty they were a bit tough because of the fibrous outside layers. - Green tea: Good. Overall the service was OK for such a small place; friendly but maybe a few too many tables for the wait-staff.This is definitely going on my list of Mountain View sushi favs."
829,"I love Sushi Tomi, its my favorite sushi place in the area! It always has very fresh sashimi and in generous portions. I usually get the Chirashi bowl and i'm always satisfied with it.It is a very popular place, so there's usually a wait. It's a good idea to make a reservation!TIP: for lunch, getting the Sashimi Lunch is a few bucks cheaper than the Chirashi bowl AND there's more fish! I learned this the hard way. hahah"
830,"Was in the neighborhood for the funeral.Sushi Tomi was recommended by my local friend but I was not sure about this place looking from outside of the restaurant even though there was a waiting line outside the store. We did not want to wait in line and decided to go elsewhere for dinner and that was good and not like memorable 5 starts.  Obviously, I regret not waiting in line at Sushi Tomi..... I keep thinking about Sushi Tomi that night somehow so my daughter and I decided to go back for lunch the next day right at opening.   Bang!!  Amazing traditional Special omakase sushi plate without fancy sauce and stuff.   Nigel.  Thank YOU so much for your recommendation.  We loved it. This is what we call ""real authentic sushi place"" .... and the price was just right."
831,"Probably one of the best sushi places in the area. The wait can be long as they don't take reservations but we got lucky and were seated within 5 minutes anyways. The nigiri was very fresh, though pricey. It ranges from $6-$15. Nigiri: Red snapper - very flavorfull Giant clam - first time having giant clam. The texture was similar to cartilege. I felt like it needed a bit of soy sauce to bring out the flavor. Tobiko - nothing special Unagi don ($19.90) was delicious, the pieces of eel were decently fatty and melted into your mouth. The best unagi don I've had was at kirala in Berkeley. This is the closest I've found to that. A downside is that the tables are very close to each other and unless you're carrying your own loud conversation it's impossible to not eavesdrop on your neighbors. Hello parents with teenage children issues - glad you're working them out."
832,"Came here for dinner with my friend the other day. We looked at their menus while we were waiting, and omg I remember they had about four menus because I kept flipping them back and forth and switching with my friend LOL. We were soon seated at the sushi bar, which was nice since we were able to see the chefs make the dishes. They looked like they were really enjoying their job! :)My friend and I each ordered chirashi, which is raw fish served on top of sushi rice. All of the fish tasted fresh and they seemed to almost melt in my mouth! I got full just from eating the fish alone, so I took the rice home since it tasted so good LOL.I would definitely come here again if I'm near the area! Plus, there's a small parking lot with lots of space right in front of the restaurant, which is always convenient. :)"
833,"Tiny, cramped, long lines at any time of day but ohhhhh that sushi makes it all worthwhile. The fish is fresh, buttery, flavorful. The Tomi roll is outstanding, the Sahimi is a delight. Even take away is done well! Authentic, fresh and delicious, by far superior to any other sushi we've eaten in all the Bay."
834,Food is just OK. Chirashi bowl is small and only few selection of fishes. Other sushi rolls are just OK. Long line waiting but not worth it.
835,"I was pretty confused when I saw my food, because I was expecting something more... and I mean that literally. I walked into this place with high hopes after seeing such rave reviews. It was small and the people were all Japanese, so I pegged this as one of those authentic, but non-innovative-sushi restaurants. I tried the Beef Teriyaki/Sashimi Combo: it was tinyyyy, charred, and dry. The side salad was small also, but the gave a generous portion of rice (which is useless if I have nothing to eat it with). The tuna wasn't bad, but I was expecting higher quality sashimi and more of it. The Salmon Teriyaki was small and dry too. The Philladelphia Roll and the Dragon Roll were OK. Pros: The waitress let me place a take-out order 15 minutes before opening. The workers are Japanese.Cons: Lack of innovation in sushi, small portions, dry entrees. If you want to get some good authentic Japanese food (with Vietnamese waitresses, heh), go to Yuki Sushi. A bit more expensive, but they give you much more of everything, unlimited rice, and everything from the salad to the sashimi is good.P.S. They don't accept AMEX"
836,"This place has definitely gone downhill! I felt sick afterwards and my clothes all smelled like raw fish. If you must go here, try out the Tomi Special roll. It was half decent I guess.- I felt sick immediately after eating here- Their sake was a dark yellow and tasted like acetone! I also asked them to serve it with the sushi but they brought it with the salad.- The place is super stuffy to the point where the windows were fogged!- Their Yellowtail/Hamachi sushi is $13 for 2 pieces? I should have looked at the price before I ordered. - Their salad has way too much creamy dressing in it- $13 for Hamachi sushi?- Their dipping dishes are too shallow"
837,"This place seems like a good solid 4 star restaurant.The food is fresh and never dry. The service is super fast. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that the ambiance could be MUCH better. It's small, cramped in, bad lighting, no music, wooden old chairs and tables. Nothing is really new and sleek here. Good fresh sushi at slightly above average prices but lacking that extra ambiance that would merit a 5 star experience.Their salads are good but the dressing is slightly watery. I liked the free edamame (complimentary if you order alcohol)I noticed they finally serve green tea with meals which is a nice upgrade they've done to this place :)The spicy tuna roll is out of this world!"
838,"This is one of my favorite sushi places.  One of my favorite Japanese places in general.  The sushi bar is always good, with quick and helpful chefs.  Fish is practically moving, it's so fresh.  Cuts are generous without being ridiculous.Tables include both tatami and western style.  I'll take either, have seated in both, and enjoyed them both.It DOES get crowded, but I expect that with somewhere so tasty.I find the prices reasonable, seating good, and their menu varies while keeping basic components always available.  Not just sushi either, but noodles and other fish and fowl dishes.  Always a good range.I keep going back, though I no longer work so near, just because it's that good."
839,"Hamachi Kama = party time. all the time.This place gets packed pretty much every evening so make reservations and then circle around Castro for 40 minutes looking for parking. Back to the food, this is a solid sushi joint and always my go-to place for fresh fish and no fancy shmancy ""crazy reverse silicon valley tiger roll"" or some crap. Come here for nigiri, insane variety of japanese appetizers, and as mentioned initially, HAMACHI KAMA. Slightly charred and super moist, you'll never be satisfied with plain edamame for appetizers again. If you are going to get a roll, only get the House Special roll, which has loads of fresh fresh and only a small bit of spicy [Kewpie] mayo sauce."
840,"Splendid. This is my counterpart to sushi infinity. That is, the place I have a proclivity to when I am not looking to gorge myself with all-you-can-eat sushi.The food is excellent and so is the presentation. In fact, I enjoy how the food looks here so much that I have the sashimi here as the background picture on my phone. Also critically important, the service here is top-notch.If you're not a fish kind of guy (or are a budgetarian), this establishment also has a legitimate katsu don, which I would certainly recommend. My philosophy is: eat here. If you like sushi, definitely eat here."
841,"In my opinion, the perfect chirashi would contain the following ingredients:*multiple slices of sake, hamachi, saba, hotate, maguro, unagi, amaebi, tamago, white tuna*ikura (salmon roe)*slices of sweeten braised shiitake mushroom*pickled radish or daikon*seaweed salad (optional)This restaurant's chirashi had the following pros and cons, relative to my notion of the perfect chirashi:Pros: Good sized cuts, unagi, the pink-edged fish cake was niceCons: Missing sliced pickled daikon, sliced shiitakes, mackerel. Only one slice per fish"
842,"I think this place is a tad over rated. I wouldn't say it was amazing for how much it cost, but I would come back here and eat here. Be prepared to wait! There is a line to get in. If anything, maybe order one of their special rolls. Don't order the seaweed salad. It's a bit dry in my opinion. Service is standard as well. Nothing special because they are so busy."
843,"We arrived at 11:30am for lunch and got seated right away.  Had Sashimi lunch special, which comes with miso soup, salad (too salty) and white rice.  The sashimi came on a small wood cutting board, 4 different fishes each with 2 to 3 thick cuts.  They were fresh and delicious.  It's very cheap for the price you pay for the quality of food."
844,"Absolutely delicious... and very affordable. We ordered two Miso soups, tempura, nigiri, sashimi, chicken teriyaki, and a glass of wine for a little less than sixty dollars. A wait of around half an hour, but the food arrives within fifteen minutes, and the quality is worth the wait. I highly recommend this place!"
845,"We had to wait ~20 mins to get in (which is always a good sign). I was worried with them being busy that we wouldn't have good service, but they were very good at making sure we had everything we needed. We ordered a lot of food and sushi and it was very quick. I had the dragon roll and rainbow roll and WOW. So fresh and great quality. Highly recommend."
846,"The food was very appetizing! The portions were generous; a group of 4 ordered different dishes (udon, sushi, tempura, and rice bowl), and we all came out happy.I'm dinging it 1 star for one reason only, and that is because the waitress came by every 30 seconds to ask us if we knew what we wanted yet. I understand the necessity to turn tables quickly, but we weren't given adequate time to consider our choices. Other than that, it was great! A good atmosphere and quick service."
847,Whoa this place is great. Came here with some coworkers at 5pm and there was already a line. The fish was fresh and not deep fried and covered in sauce.
848,"There was a super long line, so I got take out. It took about 30 minutes to get it :( [hence minus one star]... The sushi was good, I should come back and try the sushi bar. I ordered the tekka maki and sushi combination, which originally came with salmon sushi, but I asked for it to be replaced and it was, yay!I'll come back for a sushi bar experience :) They take reservations, btw!"
849,"Food is okay as long as you stay away from the chicken. I had the Udon bowl, and the flavor was good but the chicken wasn't cleaned at all before it was cooked. Fat, tendons, and chicken grissle aren't good. Also, the Chicken Karaage was flavorful, but again the chicken wasn't cleaned. My wife's California roll was very heavy on mayonaise, to the point where it overtook the dish. My daughter got a spicy tuna roll and a Dragon roll and loved it. Service was hit or miss, but overall they were very nice.Had the chicken been cleaned properly, it probably would have been 4 stars."
850,"I have had good experience in the past but this time I ordered beef teriyaki bento with sashimi, you can see the color of the salmon sashimi overly red, and when I tasted it it's definitely not the freshest, I am not saying it's completely bad, but it's not very fresh :(  sorry I hope this is just a one time thing, because I really like the place, I do have pictures but I need to find out how to upload them -- I uploaded the picture, one of the piece was with rice on it"
851,"I've been to the Tomi's in San Jose, but I have to say this location is just a little better. They have a slightly bigger selection of sushi to choose from here and the sushi also tastes a bit more fresh. Most of the sushi I tried this time around tasted really delicious, aside from maybe one or two food items that I didn't enjoy all that much. I'd say the crunchy rolls are by far my favorite at Tomi's. I have one somewhat minor complaint that keep me from giving five stars. It's the price. It's just a bit more expensive then it should be in my opinion, especially for some of the more ""fancy"" rolls like the dragon roll or rainbow roll. Those are at least $12.00 and you only get 4-8 rolls. Still quite a good sushi joint though, I very much enjoyed the food and good service."
852,"Great food, great staff and good place to eat on a Friday night! Just be prepared to wait 30-45 mins!"
853,"The wait for this place is totally worth it. I've been here twice now and the food never disappoints. Outside of Japan, this place has pretty legit and fresh sushi. There have been only a couple places in the Bay Area that have satisfied my love for sushi outside of Japan - DASH, Sushi Sam's in San Mateo and Sushi Tomi in MV. In addition, the bento boxes are a bit prices but all worth it. They give you a lot of sashimi (6-8) pieces and I always leave stuffed. Con - service is a bit slow and rushed. This place always has large crowds, so come early!"
854,"Best neighborhood spot for sushi -- good combo of price and quality. Chirashi is good, as are the rolls and nigiri/sashimi. Also like their aji fry and broiled fish.Long waits though, and FYI, the omakase here isn't really omakase."
855,Really good Sushi. Their staff was friendly and all sushi options were good (Tried 5-6). Definitely recommend this place.
856,"My favorite sushi place in the South Bay! The food here is pretty fresh and delicious. My absolute favorite is the Tomi Special Roll-- I always get it! I like the hamachi and sake one more than spicy tuna though. The orange sauce is a bit spicy and it's just so delicious!The sashimi here is also pretty fresh, and the bentos are all good. We've had the eel over rice, teriyaki beef and chicken, monk liver, and everything has always been delicious. If you're looking for a good Japanese place, this is the place to go! There can be a bit of a wait, so it's always better to come earlier and put your name down first."
857,"Good sushi, good service. The fish is tasty and fresh, the tempura is tasty. The miso soup is delicious. I recommend Sushi Tomi."
858,"Sushi was so-so.  I went on a Monday night  (heard it is normally busy) so perhaps they didn't have the throughput.  In any case, the fish wasn't fresh and kinda warm.    We had the toro, salmon belly (fatty side), and yellowtail from Japan.  Also ordered some rolls.  The California rolls (i know i know, not real sushi) was decent.  We also had the spider roll but the fried pieces were chewy and not crispy.Tonkatsu was acceptable and so were the yosenabe.  The tempura was made perfectly, especially the ebi tempura.  Some places give you a tiny piece of shrimp surrounded by a lot of tempura batter--here, they give you a real shrimp.The service is great--it is run by Japanese people after all.I gave 3 stars because it seemed the price does not match the level of food that i would expect.    Also, the seats are hard to get into...You have to take off your shoes and slide into the benches.  (Maybe it was designed for Japanese ppl...I'm 6 3 and luckily only tall, not big)"
859,"Great Japanese food at a reasonable price.  The sukiyaki is DELICIOUS & has a nice mix of those clear noodles, meat, and assorted vegetables.  Teriyaki chicken was decent & it was a nice big portion.  Their sushi and sashimi were fresh.At Sushi Tomi, I always get the combination special bento (at the very top of the menu), which is a great deal for $16.90 -- it comes with miso soup, salad with delicious sesame dressing, rice, and your choice of 2 items (pick from: sukiyaki, california rolls, spicy tuna rolls, sashimi, tempura, pork cutlet, gyoza, teriyaki, mackerel, pike mackerel)Minus 1 star because: (1) The wait time can be ridiculously long during peak hours, for example Saturday evening. (2) If they seat you in the booths on the far right wall of the restaurant, you have to take off your shoes (yes, they do enforce it) -- Annoying & gross.  Who knows how filthy the carpet is under the table..."
860,Our service sucked. The prices are high. Food was ok. Why so much brag from other reviewers?Must not be any other sushi places in the next 50 miles.
861,"A nice 4.5 upbump for exceptionally fresh fish and well-executed sushi.  Per my protocol, I always go with an Omakase sushi to gauge a new Japanese spot.  At $35 for 10 pieces, the prices are reasonable considering the quality.  Each piece was carefully constructed and I especially enjoyed the king salmon and uni.  Being a stickler on sushi rice, Sushi Tomi cooks it very well and comes second so far only to Sushi Sam's Edomata.For those that love special rolls, the Tomi Roll here with your choice of hamachi, sake or spicy tuna on the inside comes beautifully seared and devoid of any spicy mayo sauce...just a drizzle aside it to dip into if you so choose.Like some of the bay's other top sushi spots, this place gets packed quickly even on weeknights so make a reservation if possible if you don't plan on sitting at the bar.  Service is adequate and factoring in this with the better price and comparable quality, I'd actually make my way over here over Sam's if given a choice."
862,"Fairly decent sushi and sashimi establishment that benefits inordinately and is slightly overrated from being one of the few authentic joints in the immediate area. I've tried a variety of sashimi and nigiri sushi several times here and found everything to be fairly fresh, yet unmemorable, with the overall value proposition somewhat lacking. If you're hell bent on having sushi and don't want to travel far, then this is *the* place in Mountain View. Otherwise, in the grand scheme of things, this place is merely average, as far as sushi restaurants go. If you just want to spend a bundle on a nice meal regardless of cuisine, then there are many other good restaurants nearby."
863,"This place is amazing. There is usually a small wait, but it's a small resultant, and it's also worth it. The quality of their fish, the very simple menu, it's perfect. The staff is very friendly and service is very quick. My husband or I go here several times a month. So goooooood!"
864,"We ordered food from almost every category and none of them were good, everything we got have different problems and it is so disappointing! Extra special chirashi- fish wasn't fresh, some are slimy...Grill salmon rice ball- I had never seen rice ball done this way,  flat instead of round like a ball, salmon was dry like powder Chicken Udon- normal udon, soup was salty, taste a bit fishy for some reason Grill chicken skewer - no seasoningCold tofu - I could've bought it from the supermarket Service wasn't very good either, no one greeted us, our tea was never refilled, saw our waitress twice, once when we order (she wasn't very knowledgeable, the attitude wasn't very nice either) 2nd time is getting our check.Never coming back again, such a disappointment"
865,"Love it! I stumbled upon this MV gem through the help of my fellow yelpers. What's funny is that i planned on taking my bf there for dinner. Turns out to be the same place his mom took him for lunch! Apparently its been a family fave except they havent taken us! I love how Sushi Tomi is so true to its culture. The sushi chefs and waitresses are all very true to their roots which i LOVE. So far, I've tried the extra special chirashi, lunch special sashimi, and omakase. I really enjoyed them all. I think it will ultimately depend on what i feel like eating. But, for the most part, their omakese is bomb! We all started off with a salmon miso soup. Then we got 1 piece of 10 different kinds of sushi. Then we had another hot fish item. And finished it off with an orange. Plus, my dad is really hard to please. He was actually a fan of the place once he saw the quality of the fish. The only drawback is the cutting skills arent perfect but i'd take fresh fish over cuts any day.Note that this place can get pretty busy so try to come at a good time."
866,"Came here Sunday dinner for 2. Wait wasn't too long and we got a table near the washroom after about 10 minutes. relatively big line outdoors.Food came quite quickly given the restaurant was filled to capacity. Servers were friendly and cleared the table relatively promptly.Ordered the dragon roll and combination special with gyoza and spicy tuna roll. Sushi was really yummy, gyoza was meh, but their soy sauce was super salty. God dang my blood pressure must've jumped off the scale.Prices are average ... Not cheap but not outrageous."
867,"I had lunch with my mom today and the service was less than great. I had finished my lunch box much earlier than my mom, who was only 75% of her way through hers and a sever came and asked if we needed anything else - I said we would like more tea. Instead of serving us more tea, the server came back with the check and placed it on the table ""thank you very much"". There was no tea and my mom rushed through her lunch. The portions were much smaller than I remembered. Average quality. Never going back again."
868,"Over priced, mediocre foodJust got their Nigiri Special Sushi dinner to go.   Their menu online said it was $21.    When I got there they charged me $25 saying ""sorry, the online menu is out of date"".     But, it wasn't even good.    Not at all fresh.    Day old sushi.    Lukewarm soup.    Really?    This is the top rated sushi place in Mountain View?"
869,"Best sushi in South Bay! Fresh and delicious. Always a line at lunch or dinner. Well worth the wait though. We sometimes go late towards closing time and get seated faster. We see how they clean everything at the end of the day! Very important for a sushi place. Took away one star because they indirectly raised the price for some items. Deluxe sashimi used to have raw shrimp, sea urchin and raw clams. Now just plain regular fish. They created sashimi omakase to include the above special items. But the price jumped from $38 to more than $50. A little disappointed. Will still go dine there despite the stealth inflation."
870,poor sevice for chinese！They will not let you sit on a table even they have. They will not ask you even if they have.
871,"(Sigh)This is what happens in the burbs: everyone's taste buds regress and all of a sudden a place that deserves 2 stars has a 4 star rating on Yelp. If you love sushi and actually want to eat good, fresh sushi, don't come here. Again, its a palette thing. If your palette is used to mediocrity, then this mediocre place will be delicious for you. If you are used to high quality sushi, you will be disappointed."
872,Quality sushi. Authentic Japanese dishes. Great place to catch up with friends over food.
873,"Last evening my friend and I were craving for good sushi, and given that we happened  to be in this area and I bookmarked Tomi on yelp before, we went ahead to try it out.We were lucky enough that there was no line, or anyone waiting ahead of us, but it still took the waitress quite a while to notice and seat us. Then we had 9 orders of nigiri:amaebi - goodUni - good and smallWhite tuna - ok2 types of Salmon - okSquid - alrightTako - mehToro -meh. I've had better. Considering the quality, overpriced.King crab- not so fresh.Overall it's not impressive, but not that bad either. We were just disappointed since the reviews are so good. What really makes me leaving this one star review is the following diarrhea attack, and both of us are still suffering from it right now - the very next day's afternoon. We eat sushi a lot but never had this problem before. It's sad, but beware, the fishes here might not be as fresh as you may like to believe. Nobody should pay $100 for diarrhea. I'm positive that we will not come back again."
874,Good quality sushi for a fair price. The sushi pieces are thick and big on each of the nigiri....it was very satisfying biting into the big chunk of quality fish. We ordered the extra special sushi and extra special chirashi... Both are very nicely done. A few notable pieces include the yellow tail and the Toro. The eel was specially memorable... It's thick and got anvery good texture to it. We also ordered the monk fish liver and fresh oyster. All are very delightful. They open at 11:30 for lunch and ppl start to form a line as early as 11-11:15. Their service is pretty quick.. we were able to get out of there in 45- min and not feeling rushed at all.
875,"Service:  Slightly confusing setup when it comes to putting your name on the list for a table.  There was a clipboard at the hostess desk where you can add your name to the waiting list.  Was not even acknowledged by the hostess until our name was called to be seated.  Once seated, the server immediately asks if you're ready to order.  Hate the feeling of being rushed.  Pretty typical of other sushi restaurants I've visited, so if you're looking for a nice, relaxing dining experience, this wouldn't necessarily be the place. Food:  On a more positive note, we ordered the pork gyoza & a sashimi platter.  Both were very good & the fish was extremely fresh!  I'd go back for that reason!"
876,"Was leaning towards a 3 star bc my donkatsu was nothing special (a bit on the smaller side) but the sashimi I got as part of my 2 entree lunch special (great value!) was PHENOMENAL. Best sashimi I've had in a while. Still green on the sushi scene around South Bay but the substantial size and the fatty goodness of each piece of sashimi I received was incredibly impressive. Definitely gonna go back if ever I need sashimi, looking forward to trying their sushi.I believe I had a reservation so my party was seated pretty promptly. Service was neither slow nor fast."
877,"After comparing this to some other of my sushi haunts, i had to downgrade my rating. The price is a little bit more for what you get. The quality is good but not enough to justify the added cost and wait. The staff are wonderful and prompt and attentive.But for getting sushi now, I always go to ..."
878,"From the line out the door, it must be good and we were not disappointed. The wait was a little annoying being crammed into the little space shuffling like penguins.The salad is typical as well as the miso soup. What is good is the fresh sashimi dinner and the spicy scallop which was very yummie. Great place and close to my house. Going back."
879,"Let's get right to it:Winners:Kobe Beef sushi (really - and they often have it)Toro (awesome and not too expensive $10 each pair of nigiri)CHU TORO - wow, when they had it, it was even better than the O-ToroScallop and anything containing itWhite tuna (though not as good as Yakko, Akasaka or Koma)Losers:SalmonSpicy tunaOK now for you English teacher types, here some prose so give me an A:The place had quite possibly the strangest combination of premium and low quality fish I have ever experienced.  The Toro nigiri was probably the second best I've ever had (and only $10 for two pieces) but the salmon and spicy tuna were clearly subpar - dry and lacking flavor (though the spicy tuna had enough heat to melt steel).  The decent white tuna included a pleasant flavored soy sauce and the Sapporo on tap was a nice bonus. The feel of the place is best described as ""authentic Japan hole in the wall,""  though it is probably big enough to sit 35.  I may return on a weekend when the fish may be fresher.______________________________________________________Update: My hunch was right.  I came back here on a weekend and the salmon was fresh and high quality.  For the heck of it I had the kobe beef nigiri (rare to find around here, as it were) and that was perhaps the best thing on the table.  Also recommended is a special roll they had that day of minced crab on the inside and scallop on the outside.  After two trips, I've noticed that they cut the fish thin but long, making pieces look larger than they are.  This leads to not being full and buying still more.  It cost us $45 per person with no alcohol.______________________________________________________Update 2:Unrelated to this restaurant, except that I learned this from the sushi master here: toro comes from three types of fish: (1) blue fin (where much of the fish is toro grade) (2) big eye (where some of the fish is toro grade) (3) yellow fin (where little of the fish is toro grade).    Albacore or ""white tuna"" is a different fish entirely.  So is escolar, which is sometimes called butter fish or ""super white tuna,"" as it tastes like butter (or toro!) and is as white as a sheet of typing paper.Anyway, you won't get escolar at this place, but you will at Yakko or Akasaka.  And don't eat more than about six pieces per week or you will need a new digestive system.   For this reason, it's entirely banned in large parts of Europe."
880,"2.5 stars.  Went for dinner.  Quality of fish in sushi rolls was ok, but I've had better.But my biggest complaint: the place felt so DIRTY! I won't return."
881,"I loved this place! 2 of us on Sunday night. We ordered omakase sashimi $35 for 10 kinds of sashimi. We couldn't really identify what we had, but they were DELICIOUS! There were 2 pieces of each for 8 out of the 10 kinds of sashimi so we could share w/o problems. We also ordered Yosenabe as well, which is a pot filled with seafood and clear soup. It came with rice, which tasted awesome when you add the soup to it. =] Overall, I loved it. The only downside is there were 2 flies flying around our food throughout dinner, which I don't think is something that you'd like to see around your food."
882,"Quaint little Japanese restaurant slightly off the main downtown strip, I was pleased to find a good rating. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to read what I should order. The 3 of us had to wait about 30 mins for a table to open up.It took us a while to decide what to order, but the 3 of us all chose the assorted chef's special for $22 and then the gyoza and agedashi tofu apps. The apps were average, nothing special. Some of the fish tasted really fresh, and some not so much. The salmon was probably my favorite in terms of freshness that day, and the uni was my least favorite. The uni had too much of a seafood taste. Overall decent, but I wasn't really impressed considering all the positive reviews."
883,"Not the freshest fish I've had, but it's authentic enough.  It gets an extra star because of the value!  Tasty food with good portions for really reasonable prices.Our entire party ordered off their combo meals list and almost all of us ordered their beef sukiyaki.  I am a huge sukiyaki fan - tender slices of beef, tofu, and veggies soaked in a hot, delicate, sweet broth.  It really hits the spot!"
884,"I've been here many times for dinner, but this review is based on the last two times I've been here for lunch.- My coworkers have noted that the chirashi, while good, has too much rice and not enough sashimi. - The last roll on the sushi menu (Tomi special roll or chef roll) is probably the best roll they have.- Dragon roll was also pretty good.- Alaskan dream roll (contains tuna, scallop, and something else) was not that great -- as in, it wasn't flavorful enough, and the fish didn't taste super fresh.- Super bomb roll is deep fried, but the flavors weren't that memorable or good.All in all I would probably eschew this place in favor of Tomi Sushi (its Mountain View sibling) or Sushi on the Run in Los Gatos (you can see my review there also)."
885,"Easily the best, most authentic, and most reasonable Japanese Restaurant in the South Bay. Been going here every 3-4 weeks for the last two years. Service 5/5Food 5/5Sashimi Dinner/LunchGreat price (22.90) for what you get. The tuna is always tender and absent of fishy after-tastes. Salmon is super fatty and melts in your mouth. Don't even bother getting the salmon belly. They put grated ginger or something similar on the white tuna which pairs well. And best yellow tail I've had in NorCal. You get the real flavor of the fish. Never had a bad experience with the quality of the food. They're only inconsistent in one good way, sometimes the cuts of sashimi are huge. But always on par with what you should expect. ToroGot it with the extra special sashimi twice. Only 5$ more for two pieces which is a steal. Marbling is amazing, you won't even see lines of fat it's get ingrained throughout. Not a fan of toro usually but this was well worth it.UniCreamy, not too salty, great color, super crisp seaweed. If you're a fan of uni this place is a must try.OystersThey usually get them from Seattle or Tokyo. It's special menu item but definitely try it if it's available. Topped with green onions, ponzu and the grated ginger like stuff I mentioned before. Huge oysters too. My god they're amazing. Better than the farmers market or nearby oyster bars. Tempura and other cooked food is good but come here for the fish that's why they're so popular. Line can we long so get here at opening and you'll be seated within 15 minutes- even on most weekends. Servers are super attentive. Never have to ask for water and they get whatever you ask for within minutes or seconds. Really friendly too."
886,The food was delicious and fresh. We came here on a Friday for lunch. The placed filled up pretty quick. Didn't have to wait for the food that long and it was delish! You can taste the freshness. Our waitress was nice and friendly.
887,"Do not recommend. Maybe Im spoiled by the Safeway takeout sushi quality, but I really don't know why there is a line to this place. Overpriced, meh quality, long wait to be seated.  Salmon rolls were made out of minced salmon, and fatty tuna belly roll was minced tuna, but definitely not tuna belly.  Izakaya (broiled skewers - pork belly, shisamo, and chicken skin) seemed boiled, then hit with the butane torch.  Pork was very tough, and shisamo was soggy?!?   Anyways.  Sad to see this place go down hill. Go elsewhere for better food. Nijiya market grocery takeout if you have to."
888,2nd visit and it's a great place.  Get there early as they are always busy.  I will be back
889,"Got the sushi for a quick lunch break. Great atmosphere, taisty food. Parking lot in the other side of the street."
890,"The good thing about a lunch date with another tech drone (such as myself) is that we can hit up any number of places on Castro, which are normally reserved for boring team lunches. On this occasion, we happened to fancy sushi. Now Castro has a number of sushi places (and coincidentally they're always full, a fun fact that I still don't understand), but chose Tomi because both of us had been there before and liked it. I got the Regular Nigiri Lunch, and they even substituted out the shrimp and clam items. As you can see from the photo, there were several nigiri of different fish and some great spicy tuna rolls. The quality of fish was excellent; no fishy smell or weird taste even from the Mackerel! The texture, very important to me in judging quality fish, was also perfect.All in all, the food and service was good. It was a little pricey for lunch, but then you normally get what you pay for when it comes to sushi."
891,We both had the sushi sampler. The restaurant was super busy and our order came to our table in 2 minutes so we are pretty sure it was pre-made. A couple of the rolls we had were not correctly seasoned and overly spicy. I was expecting a lot more from this place.
892,"I have been here a few times, the only thing I used to remember is the long queue and nothing else. Tonight, I tried a few new dish. I was totally blown away by the sea-bass & hot sake."
893,"With all the reviews on here I was expecting to be blown away, but it's basically your basic run of the mill sushi spot. My bf ordered the sashimi lunch special and I had 2 of their special inside out rolls (dragon and salmon/unagi roll). Nice big peices but nothing special. Their menu isn't very sushi heavy, they have a large variety of other noodles or soups you can order from. I was hoping to see more out of the special rolls and that was a little disappointing. I guess I don't know what I was expecting but for the price we paid it was more of a meh reaction. We both also got the feeling that we were being rushed so they could seat the next couple. I was still eating when they brought our check.Dont get me wrong, The service was great! We were seated right away and attended to for refills frequently. Would I come back? Yes. Would it be my first sushi spot choice? Probably not. I suppose my standards are higher now that I've tried some top notch sushi at other places but this one was neither disappointing nor amazing. Just being honest yall."
894,"Love it, love it. I would eat here every day if I could, but I am a destitute college student.It is a busy little place, but I've never had to wait for too long. I usually end up eating the free gummi bears they have available, that I'm sure everyone sneezes and coughs on.This is good, cheap sushi.  I've never had anything that I didn't like here. Fuki -is- better, but only slightly and for a disproportionate increase in price. People need to realise that it's about the food and not about ambiance and decor.There's a lot directly across the street and if it's not a busy night on the Castro, you should have no problem parking. Service is always quick and friendly. Come here for no nonsense sushi and a lovely lack of sake bombs."
895,"I don't get why this place has such great reviews...The boyfriend and I came here a couple weeks ago, on a Friday night since we wanted some sushi. I'm guessing it's a good thing we went pretty early (around 5:30pm) since when we were done with dinner, there was a couple parties waiting in line to be seated.The service was kind of whatever, and the place gets pretty loud. I ordered some special roll (I can't remember the name nor can I find it on their menu online) which was decent. Nothing special, but it wasn't bad or anything. The boyfriend ordered the sashimi dinner and, to be honest, when it came out, both of our jaws dropped a little bit because it was a tiny little plate (for $21...) I know sashimi is expensive, but for $21, it was just kind of surprising. To give them credit, they weren't thinly cut...Anyways, I don't know what the big hype is since my whole experience was just a-okay. I'd probably go to another sushi restaurant in Mountain View."
896,"This is one of the best sushi spots in the area, and I am confidently saying that after tonight was my first time experiencing the restaurant. Tea, our waiter, was very helpful and kind. Great service, great food!Only issue is the long wait, although we came on a Friday night. The ambiance could use some work (like removing the printed out papers that were taped on the wall). That doesn't influence my review because the food and service was GREAT!"
897,"Sashimi lunch - 14 pieces of fresh fish melted in my mouth! It's a unique place with food that both looks good and tastes good. We also got the lunch bento - salmon terriyaki and chicken terriyaki - which I wasn't a huge fan of. It tasted good, but that wasn't as amazing as the other foods they have to offer. Service was great. The ladies are sweet and kind."
898,"Great vegetarian options. Awesome food and drinks are amazing! Fresh, healthy and yummy food."
899,"This place is often pretty packed especially at prime times during dinner and weekends so just a warning ahead of time in that regard. In terms of the food, it's the type of sushi place that seems more authentic. What I mean by that is don't expect like a bunch of different types of sushi roll choices with a bunch of sauce and crazy names.I must say that if you so go here, you must order the Tomi special sushi roll. It's a roll with sashimi on top of it that is torched with some special sauce. This sushi roll is the main reason I come back and I will always order it.For the rest of the food, it's high quality but a little bit on the pricier side for your meal. Don't forget to order the Tomi special!"
900,Love this place! This is my family's go to sushi spot. The food is great (so so delicious) and the service is amazing! The only thing- you should consider arriving about 15-30 mins early because they have first and second group seating. Consider coming here if you want to have a nourishing meal and have great service!
901,"THIS is THE place to Sushi for! Serious, The waiting is was bit longer then expected, but it was worth it. every single role!Super good quality."
902,"We order extra special sushi. The waiting time is unusual long but the tuna is really really fresh. They didn't take the reservation no matter how many people u r, and the waiting time is about 40 mins on Thursday 7pm."
903,"WARNING: they will copy your card & ID without your permission!! For people who goes to Sushi Tomi, if the server wants to borrow your ID. Please confirm with them if they are going to copy your ID and Card. So my colleague and I went to Sushi Tomi for dinner today. Although the foods are good, but when we are about to make payment with my card. The lady got my card and asked about my ID. I thought they are just going to check if the card and ID name is match. But, the lady just walk away into a small room with my ID. I thought is really weird because there are cashier outside the small room. So after few mins, I decided to go check on the server who took my ID. THEN, when I open the door. I saw the server was copying my ID and card without even asking me. I feel really uncomfortable how they can copy my personal information without my permission. Even I checked with the store manager, she doesn't feel like it is a big deal. Seems like they have done such things multiple times already. I do think Sushi Tomi provide good foods but they should also respect their customers' personal information."
904,"Still don't get the positive reviews and lines for this place. Sushi quality is just ok, and skills definition subpar... bits of skin left on and I even got a bone in my eel. At most it's ok for a place to get rolls and bento lunches for relatively cheap, for the area. But... meh."
905,"Came in hoping for a quick, simple lunch, and didn't quite get my wish. Even though there were open seats at the sushi bar and neither of the two small groups ahead of me seemed to want to sit there, it took several minutes before I could get the hostess/waitress' attention and ask if I could seat myself. I knew I just wanted sushi, but I hadn't been given the slip of paper for ordering sushi, and even though the guy was just standing there (I guess most people do the lunch combos), he wouldn't take my order. He called the waitress over, and she gave me the paper to fill out. She also gave me a plate, which had dried wasabi still stuck to it--yuck! Once I finally got the order in, everything came out very quickly, at least. But, nothing tasted fresh, except maybe the salmon. I also got chu-toro and amaebi, both of which seemed like they'd been sitting out a bit too long, and their temperature was even a bit on the warm side, which is probably why my stomach isn't feeling too great right now... I also had a shrimp tempura roll, which had no sauce or anything--just tempura shrimp with rice and a few wilted pieces of lettuce. There might have been a tiny bit of mayo or something inside but overall, not tasty. Disappointing."
906,"Get the omakase if you can; definitely worth it ! If not, the extra special chirashi is the way to go. I order it every single time I'm at Sushi Tomi, which comes out to almost every other week, and more often times, once a week. Try to get there early for the first seating, or later (around 8) if you're not a fan of waiting. Lunch can be very crowded, so arrive early or be prepared to wait a while. The hamachi kama, salmon kama, and agedashi tofu are delicious. Be sure to check out the fresh fish they get delivered from Japan that's written up on the white board!"
907,"We tried Sashimi lunch and Tomi bento at lunch time. Sashimi lunch was good. But Tomi bento was terrible.  Only sashimi part was good. Tempura was not good and chicken teriyaki was terrible. I don't feel like I would try one more but if only sashimi, it's okay."
908,"Not the freshest sashimi I've had, but decently tasty. Price is a bit high for the quality though. I'm also comparing them with sashimi in Japan, so that might be unfair.Pros:- tasty sashimi - bustling Japanese izakaya atmosphere - fast serviceCons:- price point is too high - no Japanese menu"
909,"I went here last night with girlfriend for dinner and a catch up session. We got there around 630 and waited for 20 minutes to be seated. We both were craving sashimi and the rolls did not look that great. I've been to the sushi tomi near moorpark and I didn't like the rolls there because of the rice. I am super picky about sushi rice. If the rice is not cook correctly, than it totally kills the greatness of the rolls. Anywho, enough about the rice. What we ordered was the special sashimi with extra sweet ebi, sake, scallop and unagi nigiri. Everything was super fresh! I love the ebi and the deep fried crunchy head. Mmmmm! The unagi was so good too! The salmon belly sashimi melts in your mouth. Highly recommend this place if you are craving fresh sashimi. If you are looking for rolls, I recommend going somewhere else."
910,"Finally gave these guys another shot and were so glad we did: the rolls were amazing (Dragon, Rainbow, Unagi, shrimp tempura)."
911,Sushi is good but uninspiring.  Will explore all of the other neighborhood sushi places before going back.Yellowtail and Dragon rolls were best.  Tonkatsu was bland.  Not worth the money.
912,"Pre Covid, always a line regardless of the time of day.  That alone should say something about this place.    Sashimi is some of the freshest I have ever had."
913,This is one of the best place to have vegetarian sushi. Service is extremely fast. Awesome authentic place.
914,We had some good food yesterday and we have Been eating here for years. This place has always takes care of me.
915,"I was so sad because I loved this restaurant. I ordered ""Negitoro($10)"" lunch time. It was soooo bad! First, Negitoro is not good taste and texture. I know it's like mayonnaise. So creamy! Not Negitoro. Second, seaweed is very short and not perfect Maki. Last, Negitoro is too much and rice is little. Probably they don't use good toro.If is this cost $3, I can understand. I never go there."
916,Seriously delicious! You gotta get there early because it gets packed! But the food is so good!!
917,"Totally not worth the hype because its not even authentic Japanese chefs doing the cooking part! Salmon sashimi has the average quality, meat is not even sweet of salmon taste. I would say people have over rated this place since its located in Mt View city, that has a cute little downtown and offers a lot of yummy food. We ordered 2 plates and had to pay for extra miso soup on an order of dinner combination?!!!! What the ~~~~"
918,one of my favorite restaurants in Bay Area. The Tomi special roll is definitely a must try!
919,Fun hole-in-Wall place to have some of the best sushi you will ever have. The service is friendly and sushi chefs are very personable.
920,"My friend and his lady friend told me Sushi Tomi was their favorite in the area, so I was excited to try! Located just a block away from Downtown MV means that there is street parking close tot he restaurant, woot! Majority of the reviews (and my friends) said that their chirashi special is the It thing to order. Don't get me wrong, I love fresh fish and all, but that night, I was craving a sushi roll, so I ended up ordering their Tomi Special Roll ($13). You have three options of fish to choose from for the roll - of course, I went with my favorite salmon. The roll had a fat piece of salmon and avocado inside with a slice of cooked salmon on top. I enjoyed every bite! I would definitely come back to try their chirashi special."
921,"Super disappointing as I was going off the solid 4 star average. Came on a Sunday for dinner - had the special chirashi, some chutoro, kanpachi and unagi. All the fish was lacking in flavor and flat. Their sushi rice is really embarrassing - tasted more like Chinese jasmine rice in consistency and texture and was incredibly clumpy and heavy. Serving staff and sushi chefs all looked like they didn't really want to be there - no warmth of service or friendliness. It looks like a cosy little gem of a place but it really fell short of expectations. Sushi Plus in Redwood City murders this joint at a similar price point."
922,"Great sushi, wonderful service. Highly recommended! Super kind staff, came with my son (first time he's trying sushi) and they were friendly, patient and most of all- they really listen, and not just pushing sales."
923,I was recommended this place from a co worker who said it was the best in the area and I was disappointed. I ordered the omakase and the waiter didn't even know what the fish were in it. She went back to ask the chef and only told me two of the fish. The ambiance was just like any other sushi place and they were quick to get your out the door. The fatty tuna was good but I think that's just inherent to fatty tuna. Not worth the price or wait.
924,"went in for lunch special and even though they have raised the price over the summer, it is still a good deal.the service is good today and the salmon combo lunch set is always good as reasonably priced as it always is :)"
925,we went in a group of six and was very satisfied with the service...nigiri lunch set was great and mini chirashi don is also awesome i had the tsukiji sashimi and am glad that it was wayyyy better than sashimi lunch i had last time
926,"great service (because i was sitting inside ---see my former review) I think i should have stuck with nigiri ... Sashimi, although the portion was huge, lacked delicacy --- inconsistent cut and wayyy too thick which ruined the textureMy complaint of the day: they actually forgot one piece of my tuna ... But they did bring it back to me later .. The waitress told me that they dropped it or it fell off something along those lines... I was hoping that it was just miscommunication cuz I wouldn't want to eat sth that has already fallen off my plate"
927,Service was great today (I started to see the pattern here--- servers who serve those inside not the sushi bar/cashier portion are nicer in general). The salmon kama lunch set is a total steal! Hugeeeee salmon and also more salmon in the soup!
928,Went in for lunch today ... Although I love their lunch special (much cheaper and worth $$$ than dinner). The service today was failing.--- the lady who is at the register was super rude ... And super pushy. I was walking over to say hi to my friends at another table and her gesture e was implicitly suggesting that I was causing troubles and that made me feel uncomfortable. They also forgot to bring my friend a soup that normally comes with curry lunch special (we have been here a lot for lunch so we know) when asked we were told that they ran out of soup (even though we were the second seating). It is not a big thing (we were not that desperate for soup) but it just made me feel bad especially because I expect better quality of service and attitude ... Otherwise the sushi lunch was great
929,Very authentic sushi and great Japanese food in general although I found my sukiyaki bowl to be a bit disappointing given the price tagWould recommend sticking to sushi (like nigiri not the fancy americanized roll) ;) also prepared to wait outside if u don't be there before the prime time
930,The food here is amazing. The place is not super big and gets crowded very quickly. I highly recommend going there as soon as it opens so you don't have to wait in line!
931,"Sushi Tomi has become my standard lunch spot when I go down to Mountain View to get my care serviced haha. It's a great Japanese place with all the classic menu items. I like the extra Chirashi bowl which comes with uni! Oh the uni was so fresh and delicious. The tamago was great and reminded me of the guy in the movie Jiro Loves Sushi who cried when Jiro finally approved of the way he made tamago. My boyfriend likes the caterpillar rolls here. Next time, I think I will try some of the nigiri."
932,"The best sushi I have had! Consistently delicious. The fish is amazing and incredibly fresh. The atmosphere is great, very clean and the staff is really friendly. Would DEFINITELY recommend!"
933,My favorite sushi place in Mountain View. The fish is always so fresh and the staff are so kind. I highly recommend the rainbow roll. Also love their salads. Visit if you can!
934,"Wow. Yum. Wow.Went while on a business trip with a group of 6 all of whom would be paying separately. The waitress was really helpful in offering to keep track of what each person ordered and got us each a separate check at the end (and got the right items on each check!). She was also really fast about coming to get our order and bringing us food.In addition to the great service, the food was super tasty. Orders at the table ranged from eel rice to the sashimi platter. I got a rainbow roll, a spicy salmon roll, and then later added on an order of salmon nigiri (because everything else was so good, I just wanted more).The spicy salmon roll was almost buttery; it was so smooth and soft it could have been melting into my mouth. The spiciness was perfect for my taste and the whole thing was just delightful.The rainbow roll had an incredible freshness to it. Again, the fish was perfectly tender and the experience of a different fish in each bite was a discovery of flavor. A small drop of the creamy wasabi on each piece really rounded it out nicely.The two pieces of salmon nigiri at the end were an excellent finish to the meal. I could have eaten another plateful. It was great.I'll definitely be headed back here the next time I'm in town."
935,"Awesome little sushi place, okay service. This is a great place in dt mountain view off of the main bustle of Castro street. However, be prepared to wait for a table even on a week night. It is well worth the wait! The Sashimi dinner was fresh and a good amount of food. Pricey, but what do you expect for good Sashimi. The rolls were also really nice and good portions. The only negative thing I could say was that the waitress was not very friendly and rushed us through ordering looking annoyed that we weren't ordering faster. Then she forgot to bring out an appetizer but still tried to charge us for it. All in all we had a great meal and I would recommend this place to sushi lovers."
936,"One of the best sushi restaurants in South Bay!Tomi has some of the freshest sashimis I've ever had. Every bite just melts in your melt! I also love their Tomi special roll (they sear the fish on top of the roll with a torch) which I get almost every time and their dragon roll.If you come on a Friday night, the wait is about half an hour so sign yourself up for a table and take a nice stroll down Castro."
937,"The food was all good, Tomi has great Otoro and other fatty fish, lots of great and interesting selections. The one thing that's bothered me both times I've been here now (about a year apart), is the screaming babies. I don't hate babies, but for some reason, so far 2/2 times there have been screaming babies in this place, which makes for a rather unpleasant experience."
938,"A wonderful place for sashimi.  I expected a long wait since I've always seen long lines when I pass by Sushi Tomi.  We arrived at 7:30pm and had about a 20-25 minute wait, which was shorter than I expected so it was not too bad. The orders: 1) beef tongue skewers; 2) pork gizzard skewers; 3) the croquette; 4) the extra special sashimi combo (2 pc albacore tuna, 2 pc shrimp, 2 pc salmon, 1 pc uni, and MORE ... I just can't recall lol); 5) two extra orders of chu toro (fatty blue fin tuna); 6) 1 extra order of uni.  The uni was perfect and smooth.  Each piece of sashimi tasted buttery soft and chewy. The entire meal was great. The winners of the night were the beef tongue skewers, the uni, the chu toro, and the albacore tuna.  This place is definitely worth another visit!"
939,"I've eaten here twice.   The first time I would have given it 3.5 stars.   Today it was pretty horrible.   I got the extra special chirashi.  They informed me they didn't have uni so they'd give me other fish.   It looked ok when it arrived.   Until I tried the white fish with skin on it.   It was tough and had bones in it.   I asked the chef about it and they replaced it.  But the bad knife work was all over the place.   The cheap tuna was butchered as well as a piece of white tuna.  When they delivered the fried shrimp head it was horribly greasy.   All the pieces of fish were of different sizes and cuts from the fish.  A large piece of hamachi was cut from the back creating a large fibrous center.  A final insult to the extra special was using cheap fish cake as a piece of sushi. I've eaten at sushi restaurants in San Fran, New York, and Japan.   I've never had such an enthusiastically mediocre show of a lack of fish handling skill.  I did bring up the knife work and they gave me two new pieces of mostly mushy red tuna.   Maybe Monday is the worst time to come here."
940,"The popularity of this place is not without good reason!Me and my girlfriends came here for dinner (three chirashi bowls) and they were amaaaaazing!!Service was great, food was delicious, definitely check this place out!!"
941,"The popularity of this place is not without good reason!Me and my girlfriends came here for dinner (three chirashi bowls) and they were amaaaaazing!!Service was great, food was delicious, definitely check this place out!!"
942,"First time here. Very busy.The place got very high reviews, not sure why exactly. The staff are rude, won't seat you, then trying to push you out once seated. The sushi is good, but nothing spectacular."
943,"One of the best sushi restaurants I have ever enjoyed. The fish is always fresh and the wait staff is very courteous and friendly. The restaurant is small and unassuming but the service is fast and at a very reasonable cost. I come here with my two boys who have declared that ""Sushi Tomi is the greatest in the world!"" Hyperbole aside, I agree with them."
944,"Uh,, the spicy tuna roll had hair in them and was sour ,, so I asked for another but was still sour.. almost foul. But no hair the second time. Only got charged once tho.Was our date night so I didn't want my wife to get sick so I paid and left. The Tempura udon was good."
945,"This is one of my favorite sushi places in the Bay Area. There is a another location in Saratoga, but they're both really good. I usually opt for the omakase, which is a really good option at a reasonable price for quality fish. The chirashi bowls are also a good option if you want the rice. If you come here for lunch, the deal is pretty good I think. They have a lot of combinations, and are really well-portioned.The restaurant isn't really big, so be prepared to wait. Also, parking in downtown Mountain View is not super great around dinner time, but if you drive around a little, you will find a spot on a side street or in the lot if you are lucky."
946,"Really great spot for sushi in Mountain View.  Wait can be long and the entire party has to be present to be seated.  On weekdays, arrive before 6:30pm to avoid the wait."
947,"It was our first visit today. we followed the high ranking here and were looking forward to having very good sushi. we had a mixture of rolls and Tiriaky, Miso soup and salad. the food was ok but overall max. on the lower end of our expectations. not very tasty and small portions. service was ok in the beginning but after the meal nobody came over to clean up the table or put the dishes out of our way. we are a bit disappointed about this experience."
948,What can I say?  This place is easily best sushi in South Bay.  Been there 3 times and very high quality fish each time.  Lineups are long but worth it.
949,"Are you looking for some really tasty sushi for lunch in the Bay Area of California at a pretty good price? Well, if you said yes, this place has your answer. Located in a nice community called Mountain View, I met up with a friend who really likes to eat Japanese food and got some lunch. The Sushi Lunch they offer comes with some miso soup and salad, which is fairly typical of a lot of Japanese American restaurants. They give you about 13 pieces of sushi, which should be enough for a light meal for a grown man. The salad and miso soup were pretty good starters and the portions were fairly moderate to keep your appetite satisfied before eating your main dish. I thought all of the sushi pieces were probably the freshest sushi I have eaten in Northern California, the flavor and the texture were fairly excellent. My friend ordered the current day special served in a bento box, which had fried vegetable tempura, grilled chicken, sashimi, and rice. He seemed to have enjoyed his dish as well. This place is at a very good location. It is not far from Castro Street, which is the main street of Mountain View, and the street gives you a feeling that you are in a nice and pleasant community in the USA. Interior is not too bad, and the lunch period seems to get a little crowded. Overall, I think I found one of my primary choices for excellent sushi in the Bay Area of California. If you ever make a trip to Mountain View for lunch, this place is a pretty good choice if you are really craving for some really good sushi."
950,"Delicious, fresh, authentic. The only local Japanese restaurant i'll go to even if i have to wait long. Totally worth it"
951,"I'm from Virginia, and was told that Sushi in CA is pretty darn good. This was the only Sushi restaurant I visited, but it was fantastic! I had the Chefs Choice platter ($70) and I've never had sushi this delicious before. I had no idea what the fish servings were, with the exception of the tuna, but each bite was just heavenly. If you visit Silicon Valley, and are a Sushi fan, this place is a must."
952,"Going to Sushi Tomi was a last minute decision, but luckily we made the call right before it opened at 5:30. We arrived at 5:15 on a weekday and there was already a line, but we were seated as soon as it opened. We ordered the Shiro Maguro, Caterpillar roll, Dragon roll, a Spider roll, and a 2 item Bento box with Beef Teriyaki and Tonkatsu. The items in the bento box was your run-of-the-mill teriyaki and tonkatsu. I will likely skip ordering a bento box next time and focus on what  is truly celebrated at Sushi Tomi - the SUSHI. The Shiro Maguro was sooooo good, super fresh and beautifully plated. The Spider roll here is a HOME RUN! So delicious in fact, that we ordered another roll after tasting the first one. Everything was priced higher than most Sushi joints, but it's to be expected considering where this restaurant is located in Mountain View and the quality of the sushi is clearly good. The service was excellent! Per the usual, I dropped my chopstick and it was promptly replaced. I will definitely be coming back to explore the other sushi."
953,"I ordered the beef teriyaki and my party shared a Tomi Special Roll. The beef teriyaki serving was large, but the meat was too tough and dry. The sushi piece I tried from the roll was okay."
954,"I would recommend you if you like sushi with sashimi. They don't have any baked sushi - which is my favorite. The place is not that big and always crowded, I think which means it's good. There is a public parking lot opposite the street. Pretty convenient!"
955,"Met up with a couple of friends from high school around 5:30pm on a Thursday evening.  We had all agreed that anything on Castro Street would be fine for dinner, but we couldn't figure out what to eat, so we sort of walked around while brainstorming ideas.  My friend said there was a Sushi Tomi , and I actually didn't know that because I had only heard of the other one in San Jose off Saratoga Ave, but we agreed that sushi sounded good, so we settled on this restaurant.  By the time we arrived at the restaurant it was almost at full capacity and that was only around 5:45pm or so.  We wrote down our name for a group of 4, but we were seated almost instantly in what seemed to be the last available table in the house.My friend, who had originally suggested Sushi Tomi, was the only one to have eaten here previously, and he did warn us that the prices were a bit steeper compared to other places, but he claimed ""you get what you pay for,"" meaning the sushi quality here is superb.  After we were seated, the waitress handed us menus as well as a sheet of paper with a list of sushi that we could use to order, by checking off which one we wanted.  This same friend immediately said we had to get the Tomi Special Roll.  This roll comes with three options of fish including Hamachi, Sake, and Spicy Tuna.  He said his favorite was the hamachi.  We ended up splitting this Hamachi roll between three people, and the last person got the Spicy Tuna version for herself.  To supplement the rest of my meal, I decided to go all out and order the Extra Special Chriashi bowl.The food came out pretty quickly, but I mean the majority of our food is technically raw, so I wouldn't' expect a long cooking time.  The two Tomi Special rolls came out first, and honestly, to me at least they were very aesthetically pleasing.  The both were garnished  with some sprouts and thinly sliced red onions dressed in spicy mayo.  Each piece on the roll alternated between hamachi and raw scallop that had been blow torched.  My first piece had the scallop on top, and when I took a bite I was blown away.  You could really taste the freshness and then afterwards came the beautiful char flavor.  I don't think I've experience a roll like this in quite some time, and I was mind blown.  I also tried a piece of my friend's Spicy Tuna version, and while also pretty good, it did not stack anywhere near the Hamachi one in my opinion.My extra special chirashi bowl came with pretty much everything I expected.  There was a generous portion of sushi rice topped with the essentials, salmon, tuna, yellowtail, shrimp, uni, octopus, egg, some roe, and garnishes.  Maybe 5 minutes of so after my bowl was delivered, the waitress also brought a freshly deep fried shrimp head with a lemon garnish. Again, all the fish was extremely fresh, and I enjoyed every bite I took from my meal.I haven't had super duper expensive sushi before( like $$$ or $$$$) sushi, but I feel like in my life in the Bay, I've had my fair share of sushi, and this is some of the best I've come across in the area.  I would definitely recommend the restaurant, but I'd say come early.  When we left, there was quite the number of people waiting, so the dinner rush can be a bit intense.  As I also stated earlier it is on the pricier side, but it's downtown Mountain View, and you're also paying for amazing, good quality fish."
956,"I am a sushi fanatic, with the caveat that I only want quality fish.   My girlfriend and I arrived here at 6:00pm on a Thursday and grabbed two seats at the bar.    The sashimi was fantastic, as was the chirashi and the hand rolls and the toro cut roll.   We didn't order a rainbow roll, but as we were finishing up we saw someone else's being made, and it was the best looking rainbow roll I have ever seen in my life (nice quality cuts of fish atop the roll) --- we'll definitely try one when we go back.A friendly crowd too......I sat next to Toni, who is a regular there.   Not only did she offer some recommendations, but she generously shared her jumbo bottle of sake with us.The bill for the two of us for all our fish and one Sapporo on tap was $68 + tip.   Well worth it in my book."
957,"What a day it was that I stumbled into this little gem...Having worked as a sushi chef for many years, I am often disappointed when I go out and pay good money for sushi.  I knew this was going to be different from the moment I walked in the door.It was around 1:30, a little late for lunch.  The only people i saw in the restaurant, aside from a hostess and a couple of chefs were old Japanese men.  Good sign...When I glanced up at the white board for the specials (another good sign to me) I saw one of my favorite dishes ever, a shiro maguro tataki.  To die for!That was it for me, I was sold.  This is amongst the best sushi I have eaten i my life.  EVER.I unfortunately have moved from Mountain View, but look forward to returning to visit friends and eat here..."
958,"Probably the best sushi I've had in the bay area. I had the omakase sushi, which came with sea urchin, squid, toro, albacore tuna, tai, amaebi, and other fish. My boyfriend had a normal sushi dinner set with more of the usual stuff, like salmon, eel, cooked shrimp, hamachi, etc. They're all very fresh. The raw fish is also served at room temperature, which is a nice touch (traditionally, good sushi or sashimi has to be served at room temperature.) The price is also surprising good for the quality -- my omakase sushi is only $35 for 10 pieces of delicious sushi, whereas the normal sushi dinner set (with miso soup and salad) is $21.90.I also ordered Ochazuke with seaweed, which is a traditional rice-in-soup kind of thing. Loved it.Next time I will try the chef's special which consists of 2-3 appetizers and a 10-pc sushi or sashimi set. Also, I'll try to sit at the bar, because the sushi chefs seem very friendly."
959,"Japanese comfort food --- I love their sukiyaki!!! Seriously, it tastes like my Mom made it! The service has always been very good when we go, even when they're busy."
960,"Excellent, fresh sushi. The entire meal, from salad to miso soup to sushi are top notch. The salad dressing actually goes well with the veggies, the miso soup tastes good, and the sushi is fresh and tasty - not at all ""fishy.""The restaurant was incredibly busy, yet the service was attentive. Our teapot of green tea was consistently refreshed, and our dinner came out in good time. A really great sushi restaurant that is slightly off the beaten path, but that means parking is not the nightmare that it could be."
961,"Definitely the most I've spent on Japanese food for awhile (from the most extensive and complicated menu I've seen in a Japanese place for awhile), but the fish specifically was worth it. Ordered the hamachi don and got about six thick slices of buttery yellowtail (the two words complement each other so well) and good Japanese sushi rice. My sister got a combination box with a generous portion of sashimi and crispy pork cutlet. The soft shell crab was skimpy on meat and the breading tasted strange from using old oil - kind of like salt and vinegar kettle chips. (uh huh.)Next time, omakase! Also come early, we got in around 5:45 and it was packed just twenty minutes later. People who can afford it love bringing their whole families!"
962,"AMAZING service, experience, and sashimi!  Bonus star bumped up for the service!!  I am definitely coming back here again and again.Spontaneous decision to drive out to Mtn. View  for sushi.  A friend said that the sashimi here was REALLY good, so we dropped by to check it out.  Btw, the restaurant is a few blocks off Castro, but don't worry...it's there.  Unfortunately, we arrived just as it closed.  Wah.The little restaurant was poppin! We peered in through the window...jealous of all the people who were in there.  The guy at the register apologized for being closed, but said we could order take out.  As we were looking at the menu, he had a change of heart and let us eat in the restaurant.  AWESOME!!  I usually hate going to places right as they close because I have a friend who owns a restaurant and she always complains about *those customers.HUGE slabs of fresh fish!  It was to die for.  Definitely at the top of my sashimi list.  It was great because the awesome waiter from the front was nice enough to give miso on the house.  He said there was no need to rush through our meal, but we still kept it as quick as possible.  A woman (owner?) that often checked in on us was also nice enough to offer rice too.  She was constantly refilling our tea and making sure we were doing well.  During our meal, one of the chefs came out and showed us the fresh shrimp he had.  It was still alive!!  Now that is FRESH.  He offered us a sweet deal on amaebi and told us how he would prepare the food.  Sadly, we refused his offer.  I'm not a big fan of the texture, but I'm sure it would have been delicious!Arigato Sushi Tomi!  See you again soon and not near closing time!!"
963,"Great place for lunch in downtown mountain view.  Located two blocks off of Castro street, it doesn't have any of that madness of people who want to go to the real trendy places just to sit outside and be seen.I had a very fresh sashimi lunch and a couple of extra sashimi selections... you can't go wrong with the Uni!"
964,"Yep, still loving this place!  And it is always nice to see our landlord, Michi, there working at the sushi bar.  He always hooks us up with something delicious when when go, and we'll usually buy him some beer as thanks.  Usually I'll order the extra special omakase because it includes a lot of my favorites (uni, amaebi, unagi, toro, amberjack).  I especially love how you can get sushi straight from the Tsukiji Fish Market in Japan.  One night we ordered Isaki (Grunt), Chinu (Blue Porgy), Medai (Blue Nose), Itoyoridai (Threadfin Bream), Kawahagi (Trigger Fish), Madai (Red Snapper).  Oh so heavenly!  The last time we came here, we were also offered complimentary green tea ice cream at the end of our meal and I swear it was so good I had to ask our waitress what the brand was."
965,"Tonight was my first time trying Sushi Tomi.  Since moving up to the bay area last June, this is probably the best sushi place I've been to yet.  The sushi/sashimi is so fresh and the uni is probably the best I've ever tasted!  You can tell a place is good when there are Japanese sushi chefs at the sushi bar who actually speak Japanese and there are a lot of Japanese customers.  I'm not gonna lie, it's not cheap, but well worth it.  As a side note and a bit amusing:  before having dinner here, my husband and I checked out a few condos to rent.  Mitchi, our sushi chef looked really familiar.  Hmm... then we realized he was the owner of one of the condos we were (highly) considering and saw him earlier that day when we checked it out with his wife!  What are the odds?"
966,"Grilled salmon special was fresh, buttery, and smooth. The special also came with a fish soup that had too many small bones for my liking. The soup broth was delicious minus the bones.Tuna rolls were pretty good here."
967,"THIS PLACE IS AMAAAAAZINGG! I LOVE THIS PLACE!! It's a bit pricey for some, but if you have the money this is where you want to eat. This place is very authentic they have a menu of pretty unique items you will not find at many very places, such as Natto.  If you want crazy, sauced up rolls this is not the place for you.  It's pretty basic sushi, and the ""crazy"" rolls they do have like the Dragon Roll is a little pricey.  I personally stick to the sashimi && the spicy tuna roll is the BEST I'VE EVER HAD. The sashimi quality is amazing.  Truly how the taste & texture should be. Also make sure to check the special items menu.  They always have special items. ENJOOOY!"
968,"My boyfriend and I were originally going to have lunch by ourselves here, but he ended up inviting 3 other co-workers, so to be on the safe side, I called to make a reservation. I had placed the call before they opened, and I was relieved when they answered the phone and took my reservation!Parking was a pain since it was during lunch hours. The parking lot across the street had already filled up and street parking was almost non-existent as well. We arrived a few minutes after our reservation to find that the entire restaurant had already been filled with customers, but they did save our table so we were able to sit immediately upon arrival! This was my first time here so I had some hard time choosing what I wanted...I ended up getting the lunch combo with tonkatsu & sashimi. My boyfriend ended up getting the hamachi don.The food was pretty delicious - the sashimi (both my salmon/tuna & my boyfriend's hamachi) was very fresh. The tonkatsu from my lunch combo was also very good...it's hard to find a restaurant that makes them right! The hamachi don had a little too much rice for the amount of hamachi, though, but I did enjoy the vinegar-flavored sushi rice by itself.My biggest complaint for this place is their service. It took forever for each part of our meal, and it especially took the longest to get our check & to actually pay for it since no one would come by our table's general vicinity. Overall, the food is here is decent but service could definitely be ramped up quite a bit for a Japanese restaurant!"
969,Now I was really never a fan of asian food ... but this place definitely got me hooked up :)Only been their once and really enjoyed it. The food was fresh and I enjoyed all the plates I tried (if only I can remember the names).The only downside was the fact we had to wait for quite a while for a table of 2 ... and ended sitting pretty close to the kitchen ... that should give you a feeling of how busy the place is on weekday dinners.
970,"My favorite sushi restaurant in Mountain View HANDS DOWN. The waiters are unbelievably nice, I ordered a sashimi rice bowl for lunch & the waiter told me that it would be more work it to pay half the price and order a sashimi platter. He then told me that  he would just give me a free bowl of sushi rice. My meal was delicious. My beef teriyaki bento box was big & my sister loved it. This place is the place to go if you're in Mountain View!"
971,"From the outside, it looks so tiny but inside there's a decent amount of seating. Tried the monk fish liver, gyoza, California roll and the rainbow roll. All were brought out promptly--especially considering it was a busy Friday night--and flavorful. The wait staff was very friendly and courteous. Nice decor and clean bathrooms."
972,"Came here with a group of 5 for dinner one night.  I wasn't pleased.  I ordered the salmon teriyaki dinner and it came out when my friends were half finished eating.  It's fish at a sushi restaurant!  It shouldn't take that long!  Food was good when it came out, but I'm not very happy with the service."
973,This place is always pretty busy and have to be there early for lunch or make a reservation for dinner.Their fried hirame (flounder) is a signature item for lunch.
974,"All I need to say about Sushi Tomi to give you everything you need to know can be said in 3 sentences:1. Its good, really good. 2. Its pricey. 3. Its a long wait for a table. I think almost everyone who has been here will say the same thing."
975,I remembered coming here years ago and recently came back to try it out again. So glad I did.Highlights:1. John is a great waiter and knows his sake! He let us try a few before making our final decision. Thanks John! 2. Sushi is fresh - Sake sashimi melted in my mouth like butter. Mmmm.3. Rolls are good too - Dragon & Spider Roll were delicious4. Sushi chefs - Super nice and checked up on us. They actually forgot to give us our dragon roll but apologized. We weren't in a hurry.Would definitely come back for the sashimi. The kids bento box comes w/ice cream but since my daughter wasn't on good behavior she didn't get any :) We'll be coming back again for some good sushi. We just have to come when the restaurant opens because the line was out the door. (Actually the line is always long)
976,"The fish is incredibly fresh here and just melts in your mouth! It is one of my personal favorite sushi spots in the bay. I've been to quite a few delicious sushi restaurants in LA and this place is at the top of the list for me. This is a great date spot, very cozy. Just an FYI, this place is related to Tomi Sushi in SJ.Ordered the Chef's Choice sashimi (whoever was our chef picked (obviously) amazing choices), the uni nigiri (delicious), and the special Tomi roll with hamachi. All were incredible and I was very pleased with our meal."
977,"This time I'm here for the shashimi...Let's say I was happy with the sushi rice.  I accepted the fact that mini chirashi (on the special board almost everyday) is the leftover fish they have so it's not nice and big slice like those regular sashimi or chirashi.  However, the quality of it is not best.  Nonetheless, I love the sushi rice so I still order the mini chirashi. Now we ordered a special sashimi that cost $28.  That was shockingly expensive for a value guy like me.  Dude, 12 thin slices of fish for $28 seems a little bit... one of the 6 different kind was really good.  The rest is pretty average.Good quality still, but watch out for sashimi special... ouch!"
978,"Went there again.  I still like the freshness of their fish but this time, I've paid attention to the fishes they gave for the Chirashi (regular one $17), I felt Yuzu really gave much better fish.  I got 4 pieces of tuna, 1 yellow tail and 1 white tuna, egg and 1 salmon.  Yuzu gave me 3 mini abalone, plus what Tomi gave.  Though, I remember I got more variety at yuzu.  When you order a chirashi, 4 pieces of tuna is just... slightly below expectation."
979,"I came here a few times and my favorite dish is the Chirashi.The regular chirashi is good... the special one is more expensive, and imo, I don't think I need to upgrade it.  However, the mini chirashi lunch special is a little different.  They combined left over pieces and some cheaper fish to make it.  The price is a few dollar less than regular chirashi but if you are looking for the best quality,stick with the menu one.  Nevertheless, with this kind of economy, I'm ok with the mini chirashi, it's actually not bad cause the fish still fresh, just that the texture is different when some of the pieces aren't the thick cut."
980,"Based on Yelp reviews. I thought that this restaurant was going to be super busy so I came 10 minutes before it was to open. There were 3 other people waiting so I guess it validated my decision to come early but I really didn't have to in order to get a couple seats upon opening.The pictures online looked really good. We went with the sashimi and sushi dinner. These 2 items combined go for about $50+. The taste/quality was definitely above average but I was still hungry so I went to get some pizza later on. I like when places fry the heads from the shrimp they used for the sushi/sashimi. I guess if I spent more money here on an appetizer before the sushi/sashimi, the after-pizza wouldn't have been necessary but that's what went down the day I visited Sushi Tomi for dinner. I pretty much just wish they gave more food for the price.Bottom line is above average fish for a more than you might want to spend and your empty stomach might not be totally satisfied by one expensive. entree."
